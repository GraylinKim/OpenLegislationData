Except as may be provided in regulations of the secretary  pursuant\n   12  to  subdivision one of this section, every local government shall admin-\n   13  ister and enforce the uniform fire prevention and building code AND  THE\n   14  STATE  ENERGY  CONSERVATION CONSTRUCTION CODE on and after the first day\n   15  of January, nineteen hundred  eighty-four,  provided,  however,  that  a\n   16  local government may enact a local law prior to the first day of July in\n   17  any  year  providing  that  it  will not enforce [the uniform code] SUCH\n   18  CODES on and after the first day of January  next  succeeding.  In  such\n   19  event the county in which said local government is situated shall admin-\n   20  ister  and  enforce  [the  uniform  code]  SUCH  CODES within such local\n   21  government from and after the first day of January next  succeeding  the\n   22  effective  date  of such local law, in accordance with the provisions of\n   23  paragraph b of subdivision five of this section unless the county  shall\n   24  have enacted a local law providing that it will not enforce [the uniform\n   25  code]  SUCH CODES within that county. In such event the secretary in the\n   26  place and stead of the local government shall, directly or by  contract,\n   27  administer  and  enforce the uniform code AND THE STATE ENERGY CONSERVA-\n   28  TION CONSTRUCTION CODE. A local government or  a  county  may  repeal  a\n   29  local  law  which  provides  that it will not enforce [the uniform code]\n   30  SUCH CODES and shall thereafter  administer  and  enforce  [the  uniform\n   31  code]  SUCH  CODES as provided above.  [Local] TWO OR MORE LOCAL govern-\n   32  ments may provide  for  joint  administration  and  enforcement  OF  THE\n   33  UNIFORM  CODE, THE STATE ENERGY CONSERVATION CONSTRUCTION CODE, OR BOTH,\n   34  by agreement pursuant to article five-G of the  general  municipal  law.\n   35  Any  local  government may enter into agreement with the county in which\n   36  such local government is situated to administer and enforce the  uniform\n   37  code,  THE  STATE ENERGY CONSERVATION CONSTRUCTION CODE, OR BOTH, within\n   38  such local government.
