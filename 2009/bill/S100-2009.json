  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S100\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\n\nTo provide for the primary enforcement of, and make technical\nclarifications to, the law governing portable electronic device use\nwhile driving.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\n\nSection 1 Amends Section 1225-d (2) (b) of the Vehicle and Traffic\nLaw.  Clarifies the provisions relating to the use of portable\nelectronic devices while operating a motor vehicle, and removes a\nprovision requiring a summons for operating a motor vehicle in\nviolation of this law to be issued only when there is reasonable cause\nto believe that the person operating such motor vehicle had committed\na violation of the laws of the State other than a violation of said\nsection.\n\nSection 2 Amends 1225-d(4) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law. States that\nthe presumption established by this subdivision is rebuttable by\nevidence tending to show that the operator was not using the device\nwithin the meaning of this section.\n\nSection 3 Amends Section 1225-d (6) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law.\nEstablishes that a violation of this section shall be a traffic\ninfraction punishable by a fine not more that $150.00.\n\nSection 4 Effective Date\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nSection 1225-d of the Vehicle and Traffic Law prohibits drivers of\nmotor vehicles from using portable electronic devices to engage in\ncertain activities while the motor vehicles they are operating are in\nmotion. As currently enacted, section 1225-d provides for \"secondary\"\n(enforcement, whereby tickets for violations could only be issued if\nmotorists had violated another law of the State and law enforcement\nofficers had reasonable cause to so believe. By eliminating the\nstatutory language restricting the issuance of summonses to instances\nwhere other laws were violated, police officers could now issue a\nticket when they observe a violation of Section 1225-d.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n2010 S.6810 - Referred to Transportation/A.9229 - Referred to\nTransportation\n\n2009 A.9229 - Referred to Transportation\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nNone\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\n\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
