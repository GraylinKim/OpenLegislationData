The  social\n   17    services district must complete and submit\n   18    the results of its review to the office of\n   19    children and  family  services  within  60\n   20    days  of  receipt of the sample. The error\n   21    rate for the district will be based on the\n   22    findings of the district's review and  the\n   23    office  of  children  and family services'\n   24    re-review. If a social  services  district\n   25    does  not  complete  its  review within 60\n   26    days of  receiving  the  sample  from  the\n   27    office  of  children  and family services,\n   28    the office of children and family services\n   29    shall assign an error rate to  the  social\n   30    services  district  based  on the relative\n   31    percentage of  the  district's  applicable\n   32    title  IV-E claims for the relevant period\n   33    as compared to applicable statewide  title\n   34    IV-E  claims  for  that  period  and other\n   35    circumstances that the office of  children\n   36    and  family services may consider in order\n   37    to allocate 100  percent  of  the  federal\n   38    disallowance.  The  office of children and\n   39    family services shall  apply  each  social\n   40    services  district's  error  rate  to  the\n   41    total amount of the district's  applicable\n   42    title  IV-E  claims  including  associated\n   43    administrative  expenses.  The   resulting\n   44    dollar  amounts  for  all  of  the  social\n   45    services  districts  will  be  summed   to\n   46    derive  the  total  amount  of  title IV-E\n   47    claims deemed to be in error statewide. To\n   48    establish a  disallowance  percentage  for\n   49    each  social services district, the amount\n   50    of the district's title IV-E claims deemed\n   51    to be in error  will  be  divided  by  the\n\n                                          251                        12603-12-0\n\n                            DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY ASSISTANCE\n                        OFFICE OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES\n\n                   STATE OPERATIONS AND AID TO LOCALITIES   2010-11\n\n    1    amount  of  statewide  title  IV-E  claims\n    2    deemed  to  be  in  error.  The  resulting\n    3    disallowance  percentage for each district\n    4    will  be  applied to the entire title IV-E\n    5    extrapolated  disallowance  calculated  by\n    6    the federal review to determine the amount\n    7    of the extrapolated disallowance for which\n    8    the district is responsible. Each district\n    9    will  be  credited  for the amount already\n   10    disallowed for any individual children  or\n   11    cases  found  to  be  in  error during the\n   12    federal  review.  The   exclusive   appeal\n   13    rights for the review of the amount of the\n   14    federal   disallowance  assigned  to  each\n   15    social services district shall be pursuant\n   16    to article 78 of the civil  practice  laws\n   17    and  rules; provided, however, that in any\n   18    such action all  of  the  social  services\n   19    districts  shall  be  joined  as necessary\n   20    parties and the venue of any  such  action\n   21    shall  be in Rensselaer county. Any social\n   22    services district that fails  to  complete\n   23    its  sample  review  in  the required time\n   24    frames shall have no right to  appeal  and\n   25    shall  not  be  a  necessary  party to any\n   26    action brought by another social  services\n   27    district.\n   28  The  money  hereby  appropriated  is  to  be\n   29    available for payment of state aid hereto-\n   30    fore accrued or  hereafter  to  accrue  to\n   31    municipalities.

For  all social services\n   18      districts other than the city of New York, the error  rate  will  be\n   19      based  on a review conducted by the district of a sample of children\n   20      and/or cases  determined  by  the  office  of  children  and  family\n   21      services  and  a  re-review  of  a sub-sample by the office of those\n   22      children and/or cases determined by the office.

The social\n   33      services district must complete and submit the results of its review\n   34      to the office of children and family  services  within  60  days  of\n   35      receipt of the sample. The error rate for the district will be based\n   36      on  the findings of the district's review and the office of children\n   37      and family services' re-review. If a social services  district  does\n   38      not  complete its review within 60 days of receiving the sample from\n   39      the office of children and family services, the office  of  children\n   40      and  family  services  shall  assign  an  error  rate  to the social\n   41      services district based on the relative percentage of the district's\n   42      applicable title IV-E claims for the relevant period as compared  to\n   43      applicable  statewide  title  IV-E  claims for that period and other\n   44      circumstances that the office of children and  family  services  may\n   45      consider  in  order to allocate 100 percent of the federal disallow-\n   46      ance.
