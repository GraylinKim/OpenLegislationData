  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1838\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the civil rights law, in relation to protecting book\npublishers under the shield law\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nThis bill would include the\nprotection of books and book publishers under the Shield Law by\nextending the definition of a professional journalist to include book\nauthors and including book publishers as protected agents.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nSection One paragraph 6 of\nsubdivision (a) of section 79-h of the civil rights laws, as amended\nby chapter 468 of the laws of 1981, is amended to include book\npublishers as a professional medium or agency as a work of\nprofessional journalists.\n\nSection Two subdivision (a) of section 79-h of the Civil Rights Law is\namended by adding a new paragraph (9) defining a book publisher.\n\nSection Three subdivision (b) of section 79-h of the Civil Rights Law,\nas amended by chapter 33 of the laws of 1990, is amended to include\nbook publishers as a professional medium under the exemption from\ncontempt,\nincluding absolute protection from confidential news.\n\nSection four subdivision (c) of section 79-h of the Civil Rights Law,\nas added by chapter 33 of the laws of 1990, is amended to establish\nbook publishers of present and previous employment of professional\njournalists under the exemption from contempt, with qualified\nprotection for non-confidential news.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nNew York State's Shield Law protects professional\njournalists from being held in contempt for failing to reveal the\nidentity of confidential sources or to turnover notes or any element\nof their professional work product except under extraordinary\ncircumstances. The Shield Law on its face protects all professional\njournalists in any medium. the definition of professional journalist\ncarefully drafted to ensure that no one whose profession is not\nclearly of a legitimate journalistic nature is afforded the\nprotection of the law. While New York State courts to date have\nproperly held the Shield Law to cover a professional journalist\nworking in any medium.\nincluding a professional author working on a manuscript for\npublication by a book publisher, the absence of the specific mention\nof \"book\" or Book publisher\" is of real concern to professional\njournalists working in the medium of books, due to the negative\ncourt decisions in other states where the failure of those state\nstatutes to specifically mention book and book publisher was cited to\nhold that book authors and publishing companies were not included.\nThis amendment is intended to ensure that the legislative intent of\nthe existing law is respected. by not leaving any doubt that book\n\n\nauthors and publishing companies are of course covered by the\ndefinition of professional journalist.\n\nThis bill does not extend the range of the Shield Law to any new\ncategories of people; rather. it clarifies what is already there by\nspecifically citing books and book publishing as a protected medium\nto which the coverage of the Shield Law extends.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.3660 of 2009-2010, Referred to Codes\nA.3480 of 2007-2008\nA.9974 and S.1921 of 2006\nA.5836 and S.1921 of 2005 (became inactive)\nA.4860 and S.847 of 2003-2004\nA.569 and S.708 of 2001-2002\nA.664 and S.779 of 1999-2000\nA.1588 and S.434 of 1997-1998\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
