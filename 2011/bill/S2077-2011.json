The legislature hereby declares that, as  a  matter  of  state\n   46  policy, caring services and programs for seniors should be shaped by the\n   47  principles  of  strengthening independence, affirming dignity, and maxi-\n   48  mizing choice, and a recognition that seniors  and  their  families  and\n   49  intimates provide a vast potential source of social, cultural, historic,\n   50  and spiritual enrichment and leadership.\n   51    The  office  shall enunciate these principles in the form of a bill of\n   52  rights for seniors, and shall, in addition to any other report  required\n   53  by  this  section,  report  annually,  not later than June first of each\n   54  year, on the progress being made in their advancement by state  agencies\n   55  and  local  governments in the development and operation of programs for\n\n       S. 2077                             5\n\n    1  seniors. Such report shall discuss progress in the following  principles\n    2  with respect to programs for seniors:\n    3    (a)  Seniors  needing long term care in an institution or in an appro-\n    4  priate community-based alternative should be able to obtain such care at\n    5  an affordable cost in a timely  manner  from  reliable  and  responsible\n    6  providers  who  can  provide  choices that meet the preferences of these\n    7  seniors, and who have the capacity to provide  a  smooth  transition  to\n    8  other  forms  of  long term care when appropriate. Such programs should,\n    9  whenever possible, provide a continuum of quality  health  care,  either\n   10  within a single institution, or through a consortium of providers.\n   11    (b)  Public  policy  should  affirm seniors' desire to maintain a high\n   12  quality of life by living with dignity  in  their  own  communities,  by\n   13  supporting  the  efforts  of informal caregivers such as family, friends\n   14  and neighbors who provide  eighty  percent  of  all  personal  care  and\n   15  assistance to seniors.\n   16    (c)  A  goal  of  policy  and  programs  in New York should be to help\n   17  seniors obtain or maintain affordable and  secure  housing  that  allows\n   18  them to age in place in their own communities with supportive assistance\n   19  and access to health related services in a manner that ameliorates prob-\n   20  lems of income, changes in family structure, health, threats to personal\n   21  safety, and architectural and structural inadequacies.\n   22    (d) Programs intended to offset excessive health care and prescription\n   23  drug  costs  for seniors, and to make health care, particularly wellness\n   24  and prevention programs, more affordable, should be designed  to  expand\n   25  choice  and  promote  ease  of  access for seniors rather than to simply\n   26  provide ease of management  and  control  for  bureaucrats  and  program\n   27  managers.\n   28    (e) State and local policies and program guidelines should support the\n   29  most  creative and flexible approaches to providing care for seniors, so\n   30  as to promote and sustain the autonomy and mobility of seniors,  and  to\n   31  tap their potential to enrich their communities.\n   32    (f)  Seniors  should be able to continue their productive lives in the\n   33  community of New York without fear of discrimination based on  age,  and\n   34  public policy should seek means of increasing opportunities for contrib-\n   35  ution  from  these  respected members of our community by supporting and\n   36  encouraging a healthy social environment that enables seniors to contin-\n   37  ue their productive lives if they  wish,  that  affirms  and  encourages\n   38  their  ability to achieve financial security, and that works to preserve\n   39  their dignity, safety, and independence.\n   40    (g) Public programs should  promote  personal  security  for  seniors,\n   41  encourage  personal  responsibility of their families and intimates, and\n   42  recognize and build on the interdependence of all  generations  and  the\n   43  diversity of our population.\n   44    (h)  Public  investment  in  programs  providing health care and other\n   45  social help for seniors should be provided at  a  level  which  supports\n   46  public mandates with respect to these programs.\n   47    (i)  No  declaratory  relief,  injunctive remedy or monetary liability\n   48  against the state of New York or any political subdivision  thereof,  or\n   49  any  public  or private entity, domiciled or doing business in the state\n   50  of New York, or any employee or officer thereof,  shall  be  created  or\n   51  granted based upon the principles set forth in this subdivision, or upon\n   52  the  enunciation  of  said  principles to be made by the office pursuant\n   53  thereto. No claim for contribution or indemnification shall  be  created\n   54  based  upon this subdivision. No assignment of claim shall be prosecuted\n   55  based upon this subdivision.\n\n       S. 2077                             6\n\n    1    (j) Existing powers of the office for the aging shall not  be  changed\n    2  by this subdivision.\n    3    [5.]  7.  Every  state  department,  bureau, or agency or office shall\n    4  cooperate to the fullest extent possible in providing such data  as  the\n    5  office  may  need to assemble such reports, including recommendations by\n    6  the director to the governor and legislature.\n    7    S 5. This act shall take effect immediately.\n",
