  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1689\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto authorize certain health care professionals licensed to practice in\nother jurisdictions to practice in this state in connection with an\nevent sanctioned by the World Triathlon Corporation;\nand providing for the\nrepeal of such provisions upon expiration thereof\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis legislation allows health care\nprofessionals to perform\nservices at the Ironman triathlon to be held on July 24, 2011 in Lake\nPlacid, New York.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1- allows any person who is licensed to\npractice as a physician, physician's assistant, massage therapist,\nphysical therapist, chiropractor, dentist, optometrist, nurse, nurse\npractitioner or podiatrist in another state or territory, who is in\ngood standing with such state or territory, and who has been\nappointed by World Triathlon Corporation to provide professional\nservices to competitors at this Ironman event.\n\nSection 2- provides the effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe triathlon in Lake placid is a one day 2.4-mile swim\nand 112-mile bike ride which concludes with a 26.2-mile marathon.\nAs this event is physically taxing on the athlete, the health and\nsafety of the participants in the days before the event and\nespecially during and after the event is crucial. This legislation\nwould allow licensed health care professionals from other states who\nvolunteer and are sanctioned by world Triathlon Corporation to\nperform services for the athletes.\n\nEspecially important at Ironman events is the \"massage\" tent that is\navailable to the athletes following the race where muscle cramps and\nminor aches and pains can be attended to. Without this immediate\nattention, many of these competitors would require further intensive\nmedical\nintervention. The average time an athlete spends in this area is\napproximately seven minutes, which is not a formal massage treatment\nby any means. To service the 1,500 athletes, licensed volunteers from\nother states are necessary.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nLegislation of this type has been passed by the\nLegislature in the past for the Olympic Games in Lake Placid in 1980\nand the Goodwill Games in New York City in 1997 as well as for the\n\n2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 Ironman\nUSA triathlons in Lake Placid.\n\n2010: Chapter 159\n2009: Chapter 81\n2008: Chapter 125\n2007: Chapter 360\n2006: Chapter 131\n2005: Chapter 45\n2004: Chapter 112\n2003: Chapter 128\n2002: Chapter 199\n2001: Chapter 115\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect July 20, 2011 and shall\nexpire and be deemed repealed July 25, 2011.\n\n",
