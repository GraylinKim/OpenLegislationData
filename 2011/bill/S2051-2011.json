  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2051\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the social services law, in relation to the local social\nservices district's conciliation procedure following a public assistance\nrecipient's noncompliance with mandated work activities\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThis bill would amend Social Services Law &sect; 341(1) to clarify that\nprior to applying sanctions against a public ass~stance participant\nfor failing to comply with employment requirement, the local social\nservice district need only find that the public assistance\nparticipant failed to comply \"without good cause.\"\n\nREASONS FOR SUPPORT:\nSocial Service Law 341(1) provides for a conciliation procedure at\nwhich a public assistance participant who has failed to comply with\nemployment requirements is given an opportunity to explain their\nreason for noncompliance. If the local social services district\n(\"LSSD\") matter is not resolved during the conciliation, then the\nLSSD notifies the participant in writing by serving a notice of\nintent to reduce or deny the public assistance grant and informs the\nclient of the right to a fair hearing.\n\nThis legislation clarifies that in order for a LSSD to make a decision\nnot to resolve the matter at the point of conciliation, a LSSD must\ndetermine that the individual has acted without good cause. This\nstandard was historically applied by LSSDs but confusion has\ndeveloped because of language in Social Service Law 341(1), which\nrequires a finding of \"willfulness\" as well as lack of \"good cause.\"\n\nUnder state regulations \"good cause\" is deemed to include\n\"circumstances beyond the individual's control, such as, but not\nlimited to, illness of the member, illness of another household\nmember requiring the presence of the member, a household emergency,\nor the lack of adequate child care for children who have reached age\n6 but are under age 13,\" 18 NYCRR 385.12 (c) (1); see SSL 341 (6).\nGood cause is a standard that is easily understood and applied. An\nadditional determination of \"willfulness,\" however, is not easily\nunderstood and nearly impossible to apply because it requires a\ndetermination of the participant's intent at the time of the\nparticipant's failure to comply.\n\nMoreover, requiring a determination of \"willfulness\" is not consistent\nwith the intent of the statute. It appears the additional\nrequirements in Section 341(1) were left in the statute inadvertently\nwhen the Legislature implemented welfare reform in 1997. Section 148\nof Chapter 436 of\nthe Laws of 1997 (\"The Welfare Reform Act of 1997\") added a new\nSection 342, providing sanctions for failure to participate in work\n\nactivities \"without good cause.\" Section 342 contains no\n\"willfulness\" requirement.\nThis proposed amendment reconciles the two provisions to be consistent\nwith the intent of the State's welfare reform law. It will also\nassist LSSDs to meet required federal work participation rates by\nsimplifying and clarifying the element of intent for compliance with\nwelfare reform employment activities.\n\nAccordingly, the Mayor urges the earliest possible favorable\nconsideration of this proposal by the Legislature.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
