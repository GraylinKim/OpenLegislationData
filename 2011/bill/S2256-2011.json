  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2256\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law and the general business law, in relation to\nincreasing protection for minors from exposure to obscene materials\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo increase the age at which young persons may be legally\nexposed to obscene materials and to protect young employees from such\nexposure.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThe bill amends 235.20 of the\npenal law by\nraising the legal age at which young persons may be legally exposed\nto obscene materials from 18 to 21 years of age. The bill also\ncreates a new article 29-JJ of the general business law which\nprohibits retailers from employing persons under 21 years of age to\nparticipate in the sale of obscene materials.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nWhile the United States has a long and\nhonored\ntradition of protecting freedom of speech, every society has to agree\nto reasonable and considered limits on that speech. Similar to the\nclassic example used by Justice Louis Brandels which prohibited a\ncitizen from yelling \"fire\" in a crowded theater, pornography is a\ntype of speech which has to have clear and enforceable limitations on\nits exposure to certain populations. Pornography depicts graphic and\nsexually explicit images which mostly feature the subordination of\npeople. Some men are depicted as subordinate but most often women are\nthe ones in these degrading roles. Pornography presents people in a\ndehumanized manner, often as sexual objects, things or commodities.\nOften people are depicted as enjoying pain or humiliation, or they\nare presented as experiencing sexual pleasure in being forcibly\nraped. In pornography people are often presented in postures of\nsexual submission and servility who are tied up, cut up, mutilated,\nbruised or physically hurt. This bill would shield young people from\nexposure to materials in which people, and mostly women, are\npresented in scenarios of degradation, injury, torture, or are shown\nas filthy or inferior. There is extensive academic\nresearch which suggests that such dehumanizing pornography\ncauses measurable harm toward women. While this bill does not attempt\nto outlaw pornography -- it does attempt to increase protections for\nyoung populations who may be the people most influenced by such\nmaterial.\n\nFISCAL IMPACT TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nOne hundred and eighty days after it\nshall have become\na law.\n\n",
