  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1798\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the insurance law, in relation to\naccelerated payment of the\ndeath benefit rider under a life insurance policy\n\nPURPOSE:\nThe purpose of this bill is to expand the definition of the term \"life\ninsurance\" so that it includes the coverage of persons and have\npayouts made to such persons at times other than death. Under this\nbill, a life insurer would be required to offer an accelerated death\nbenefit rider where the payment would be available upon such insured\nresiding in a nursing home for three months or for conditions for\npayment provided for in Insurance Law section 1113(a) (1) (C) or (D)\nwhich relates to the provision of long term care.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1: Amends Insurance Law section 1113(a) (1) to expand the\ndefinition of life insurance to include the coverage of persons who\nhave been a resident of a nursing home for three months or more and\nto make such event an insurable event under a life insurance policy.\n\nSection 2: Amends Insurance Law section 3201(c) (11) to add life\ninsurance policies that have a trigger for payment of the benefit\nupon residing in a nursing home for three months or more as one of\nthe types of policies that the Insurance Department must approve the\npolicy form for before an insurer can begin to sell such a product to\nthe general public.\n\nSection 3: Amends Insurance Law section 3230 to require that a new\nrider for an accelerated payment of a death benefit or special\nsurrender value be offered to persons who purchase life insurance in\nNew York State.\nThis rider, while mandated to be offered, can be purchased by the\ninsured at their sole option. Further, for those life insurers that\ndo specialize in long term care insurance or issues related to\nnursing home care, could offer such an accelerated payment rider\nthrough another admitted life insurer that specializes in this line\nof business as an addendum to the core life insurance policy.\n\nSection 4: Amends Insurance Law section 3230(f) to add the payment of\nan accelerated payment of a death benefit or special surrender value\nupon the insured residing in a nursing home for over three months.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nAs the general population becomes older, more and more individuals are\nlooking for affordable ways to pay for the financing of their nursing\nhome and long term care. While there are available policies that\nprovide payment for long term home health care, more products should\nbe authorized and offered under New York Law so that consumers will\nhave more types of insurance coverage made available to meet their\nspecific needs or the needs of their family.\n\n\nThis bill expands the definition of \"life insurance\" so that policies\ncan be written in New York that provide financing for those who have\nbeen in nursing home care for at least three months. currently, 49\nother states offer life insurers the ability to write this type of\ncoverage in\n\nThe united States, but not New York. This bill takes care of this\ndiscrepancy.\n\nFurther, the bill requires that those insurers that offer life\ninsurance policies must offer this coverage as a rider to the core\nlife insurance policy. The insured is under no obligation to purchase\nsuch an accelerated death benefit rider.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010 - S.1981-B - REFERRED TO INSURANCE\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n270 days after this bill shall become law.\n\n",
