Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds and\n    2  declares  that  the  challenge  facing  this  state's  child  protective\n    3  services program demands that a bold new approach be tested to determine\n    4  how  this  state can fulfill its obligations to protect and defend chil-\n    5  dren, provide for their health, safety and welfare, and also make neces-\n    6  sary services and assistance available to families in a less  confronta-\n    7  tional   and   intrusive  manner,  when  circumstances  so  warrant.  By\n    8  establishing a system in Westchester county, where complaints of alleged\n    9  child abuse and maltreatment are assigned to either an investigatory  or\n   10  a family assessment and services track, it is the intent of the legisla-\n   11  ture  to  study and review alternative methods of fulfilling those obli-\n   12  gations and, at the same time, initiate the  delivery  of  comprehensive\n   13  family rehabilitative services to children and families.\n   14    S  2.  Short  title.  This  act shall be known and may be cited as the\n   15  \"Westchester county dual track demonstration project\".\n   16    S 3.
