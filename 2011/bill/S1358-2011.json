  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1358\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the insurance law, in relation to extending owner controlled\ninsurance programs in certain instances\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nThis bill would expand the ability of the Metropolitan Transportation\nAuthority (MTA), to use owner controlled insurance programs in\nconnection with bus facilities and bridge and tunnel capital projects.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nThis bill would amend Insurance Law &sect; 2504(a)(2)(B) to expand the\nuse of owner controlled insurance programs for the MTA to include\nbus facilities and bridge and tunnel capital projects.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\n\nCurrently, the MTA is permitted to use owner controlled insurance\nprograms only in connection with the construction of electrical\ngenerating and transmission facilities or construction, extensions\nand additions of light rail or heavy rail rapid transit and commuter\nrailroads.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\nThis is a new bill.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nThe MTA currently uses owner controlled insurance programs in\nconnection with its multi-billion dollar subway and commuter capital\nprograms.\nExisting law restricts the use of owner controlled insurance programs\nfor other major projects, such as bridge and tunnel projects. MT A\nbelieves that this amendment will allow it to bring the same cost\nsavings to these additional projects that it has already experienced\nin connection with the subway and commuter railroad capital program.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n2009-10 - S.4470/A.7875\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nThis bill will have no direct state budget implications. However, the\nprograms already in use at MTA are estimated to have saved well in\nexcess of one hundred million dollars.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
