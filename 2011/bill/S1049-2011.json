PARKER, PERKINS -- read twice and ordered printed,\n         and when printed to be committed to the Committee on Energy and  Tele-\n         communications\n\n       AN  ACT  to amend the public service law and the public authorities law,\n         in relation to requiring the public  service  commission  to  annually\n         review  the compensation and benefits paid to certain officers, direc-\n         tors and high-level employees of certain gas or electric corporations\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section  1. The legislature hereby finds and declares that the compen-\n    2  sation and benefits provided to certain officers, directors,  and  high-\n    3  level  managerial  employees of certain gas or electric corporations may\n    4  be excessive and out of proportion with objective measures  of  perform-\n    5  ance,  equity, and fairness. Some top executives of certain gas or elec-\n    6  tric corporations have inflated their compensation, even as the  custom-\n    7  ers they serve continue to struggle with the burdens of wage stagnation.\n    8    Establishing  control over levels of compensation and benefits paid to\n    9  high-level managerial employees of certain gas or electric  corporations\n   10  is  clearly  in the public interest. By doing so, the state will be able\n   11  to provide assurance to the ratepayer that his or her  dollars  are  not\n   12  being spent on exorbitant salaries for top executives of gas or electric\n   13  corporations.\n   14    It  is  the  purpose of this legislation to require the public service\n   15  commission to review the  proposed  salary  and  benefits  of  officers,\n   16  directors  and  high-level managerial executives of certain gas or elec-\n   17  tric corporations and, based on  enumerated  criteria,  either  approve,\n   18  modify or reject such proposed salaries and benefits.\n   19    S  2. The public service law is amended by adding a new section 5-a to\n   20  read as follows:\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD02124-01-1\n\n       S. 1049                             2\n\n    1    S 5-A. REVIEW OF  COMPENSATION  AND  BENEFITS  PROVIDED  TO  OFFICERS,\n    2  DIRECTORS  AND  CERTAIN  EMPLOYEES  OF GAS OR ELECTRIC CORPORATIONS WITH\n    3  GROSS INCOME EXCEEDING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. 1. THE COMMISSION\n    4  SHALL REVIEW  THE  PROPOSED  OR  EXISTING  SALARY,  BENEFITS,  INCLUDING\n    5  RETIREMENT BENEFITS, BONUSES, CONSULTING CONTRACTS AND ANY OTHER FORM OF\n    6  REMUNERATION PROPOSED TO BE PAID TO ANY OFFICER, DIRECTOR OR EMPLOYEE OF\n    7  THE  GAS  OR ELECTRIC CORPORATION IN A HIGH-LEVEL MANAGERIAL POSITION TO\n    8  DETERMINE IF SUCH PAYMENTS ARE JUST, REASONABLE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTER-\n    9  EST. SUCH REVIEW SHALL OCCUR EACH TIME A  GAS  OR  ELECTRIC  CORPORATION\n   10  RECEIVES  A MAJOR RATE INCREASE BUT SHALL NOT OCCUR LESS FREQUENTLY THAN\n   11  ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS. IN MAKING  SUCH  DETERMINATION,  THE  COMMISSION\n   12  SHALL CONSIDER:\n   13    (A)  THE  COST  TO THE RATEPAYER OF THE SERVICE PROVIDED BY THE GAS OR\n   14  ELECTRIC CORPORATION COMPARED TO THAT OF OTHER GAS  OR  ELECTRIC  CORPO-\n   15  RATIONS  IN  THIS  STATE, OTHER STATES AND OTHER REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY,\n   16  PROVIDING THE SAME OR SIMILAR SERVICE;\n   17    (B) SERVICE RELIABILITY, FREQUENCY OF  INTERRUPTIONS  IN  SERVICE  AND\n   18  DURATION OF TIME BEFORE RESTORATION OF SERVICE;\n   19    (C) RELATIVE PRODUCTIVITY OF MANAGEMENT AND LABOR;\n   20    (D) COST EFFECTIVENESS OF PLANT OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE;\n   21    (E)  LEVEL  OF  EXPERIENCE IN THE BUSINESS OF THE OFFICER, DIRECTOR OR\n   22  HIGH-LEVEL MANAGERIAL EMPLOYEE IN A POLICY MAKING POSITION;\n   23    (F) GENERAL EFFICIENCY OF THE ORGANIZATION;\n   24    (G) GENERAL ECONOMIC CLIMATE OF THE REGION SERVED;\n   25    (H) THE NUMBER OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS;\n   26    (I) THE RATE OF RETURN PROVIDED TO THE STOCKHOLDERS;\n   27    (J) THE COMMENTS OF ANY INTERESTED PARTY;\n   28    (K) THE EFFECT UPON THE MORALE OF OTHER EMPLOYEES;\n   29    (L) THE IMPACT UPON THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THE GAS OR ELECTRIC CORPO-\n   30  RATION; AND\n   31    (M) ANY OTHER FACTORS WHICH WILL FAIRLY BALANCE THE INTERESTS  OF  THE\n   32  RATEPAYERS AND THE STOCKHOLDERS.\n   33    2.  AFTER  SUCH  REVIEW  THE COMMISSION SHALL EITHER ACCEPT, REJECT OR\n   34  MODIFY THE COMPENSATION, BENEFITS AND CONSULTING CONTRACTS AND THE DECI-\n   35  SION OF THE COMMISSION SHALL BE BINDING UPON THE GAS OR ELECTRIC  CORPO-\n   36  RATION, SUBJECT TO REVIEW PURSUANT TO ARTICLE SEVENTY-EIGHT OF THE CIVIL\n   37  PRACTICE LAW AND RULES.\n   38    3.  THE COMMISSION SHALL PROMULGATE RULES AND REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT\n   39  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION.\n   40    4.  FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, THE TERM  \"GAS  OR  ELECTRIC  CORPO-\n   41  RATION\"  SHALL INCLUDE EITHER A GAS OR ELECTRIC CORPORATION OR BOTH SUCH\n   42  CORPORATIONS, WITH A TOTAL GROSS INCOME EXCEEDING FIFTY MILLION  DOLLARS\n   43  ANNUALLY.\n   44    S 3. Section 1004 of the public authorities law, as amended by chapter\n   45  506 of the laws of 2009, is amended to read as follows:\n   46    S  1004.  Officers  and employees; expenses.

NO  LESS  FREQUENTLY  THAN ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS, THE TRUSTEES\n    4  SHALL  CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE SALARIES, BONUSES AND BENE-\n    5  FITS, INCLUDING RETIREMENT BENEFITS, OF OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES  AND  REPRE-\n    6  SENTATIVES  IN  HIGH-LEVEL  MANAGERIAL POSITIONS WITHIN THE AUTHORITY TO\n    7  DETERMINE IF SUCH SALARIES AND BENEFITS ARE JUST, REASONABLE, AND IN THE\n    8  PUBLIC'S INTEREST.   THE TRUSTEES SHALL REPORT  THEIR  FINDINGS  TO  THE\n    9  GOVERNOR,  THE  TEMPORARY PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE AND THE SPEAKER OF THE\n   10  ASSEMBLY WITHIN NINETY DAYS IMMEDIATELY  FOLLOWING  COMPLETION  OF  SUCH\n   11  REVIEW.\n   12    S 4.
