  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1368\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the family court act, in relation to contracts for the\ntransportation of children\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS OF BILL:\nThis proposal amends Section 236 of the Family Court Act to enable the\nCity of New York to award contracts for transportation of\nprekindergarten and early intervention children through a request for\nproposals process and to require consideration of requirements\nrelating to the employment, compensation, hiring, and retention of\nemployees when evaluating such proposals.\n\nThe references to the board of education of the city school district\nare to the definition included section 2590-B(1) of the Education Law\nas amended by Chapter 91 of the Laws of 2002.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nFor many years the New York city Department of Transportation has\nprocured and administered contracts for the transportation of\npreschool special education children and developmentally delayed\ninfants and toddlers under the Early Intervention program.\n\nSeveral years ago, the City made the determination to move these\ncontracts to the Board of Education of the City School District of\nthe city of New York (known in the city as the Department of\nEducation or DOE), which already provides transportation to a much\nlarger student population. The transfer was made to draw on DOE's\nexpertise in this area, thereby enhancing the performance of this\ncritical function. This proposal facilitated the unification of bus\nservice under one department.\n\nThis bill will allow DOE to award these contracts through a request\nfor proposals and to require contractors to accept requirements for\nthe protection of bus company employees. Including these requirements\nin the RFP's will ensure stability in the provision of services to\nvulnerable children by an industry that faces a growing demand for\nqualified drivers\nand other employees. Companies have had a hard time recruiting\nqualified drivers, and to a certain extent, escorts or attendants.\nRequiring the inclusion of employee protection provisions in these\ntransportation contracts will safeguard the children by helping to\nensure retention of an experienced pool of drivers and other\nemployees by protecting the wages and benefits of such employees.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-10 - S.4625/A.8102 - Passed Senate\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\n\nThere is minimal fiscal impact to the Local government for this\nlegislation. The New York City Department of Education has routinely\nincluded these provisions in their bus contracts for the\ntransportation of school children since 1979. This legislation would\nmerely codify this existing practice for pre-K and early intervention\nbus contracts, which were transferred to the jurisdiction of the New\nYork City Department of Education in 2006.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
