Local governments shall adopt, by\nJanuary 1, in the year next succeeding the year in which this bill\ntakes effect, comprehensive investment guidelines which conform with\nthose. issued by the Comptroller.\n\nThe investment guidelines shall include:\n\n(1) a detailed list of permitted investments;\n\n(2) procedures and provisions to fully secure the local government's\nfinancial interest in investments;\n\n(3) a requirement that the local government enter into written\ncontracts pursuant to which investments are made;\n\n(4) standards for the diversification of investments, including\ndiversification with respect to types of investments and firms with\nwhich the local government entity transacts business;\n\n(5) standards for the qualification of investment agents; and\n\n(6) provisions for reporting on the investments of the local\ngovernment including provisions for an annual independent audit of\nall investment practices.\n\nThis bill requires both the Comptroller and local governments to\nreview the investment guidelines and procedures at least annually.\nThe bill amends the State Finance law and the general municipal law\nto provide investment guidelines for local governments to reflect\never-changing market conditions.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nWith the recent problems of certain local governments facing the\npossibility of losing taxpayers' money due to the bankruptcy of an\n\ninvestment firm, it appears that legislative action is necessary.\nSaid action should provide and maintain investment guidelines to aid\nour local governments in their investment decisions in a rapid\nchanging marketplace with a variety of investment instruments and a\nlarge and changing group of investment companies.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nThere may be minimal administrative costs, but this is a potential\nsavings that may be realized from avoidance of future loss due to\nbankruptcy of investment firms.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
