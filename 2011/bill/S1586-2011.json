  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1586\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the education law and\nthe general municipal law, in relation to assignment of\ncontracts by school districts\nand providing for the\nrepeal of such provisions upon expiration thereof\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 amends Section 305 of the education law requiring the\nCommissioner of Education to survey school districts 4 years after\nthen enactment of this legislation to examine the effect of this\nexemption on the cost and duration of school construction projects.\n\nSection 2 amends section 101 of the general municipal law by adding a\nnew subdivision 6 allowing school districts to hire a single\ncontractor for work on school district facilities. School districts\nelecting a single contractor may require the apparent low bidder and\nsecond low bidder to submit the names of the bidder's proposed\nsubcontractors. The proposed subcontractors may be rejected by a\nschool district on the same basis an apparent low bidders' bid may be\nrefused. Proposed and approved subcontractors may not be changed\nwithout written approval of the school district. Payment of\nsubcontractors shall be in accordance with Section 106-b of the\nGeneral Municipal Law (prompt payment). The bidder shall specify the\nvalue to be paid to each subcontractor. A school district may reject\nany bid if the business organization, resources, financial standing,\nor experience of the bidder justifies such rejection.\n\nSection 2 amends Section 19 of Chapter 738 of Laws of 1988 to extend\nthe exemption from Section 101 of the General Municipal Law to June\n30, 2014.\n\nSection 3 sets the effective date and establishes the length of the\nterms of the aforementioned provisions to be five years.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThis bill will authorize districts to utilize a single guaranteed\nmaximum price general contractor or a full construction management\ncontract rather than the multiple contractors currently required\nunder the provisions of the Wicks law.\n\nAs a part of the 2008 enacted budget the Legislature established new,\nhigher Wick's thresholds.\nPublic works projects were deemed exempt from the compliance with the\nprovision of Wicks for jobs valued at $3 million in New York City,\n$1.5 million in Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk counties, and\n$500,000 in all other parts of the state.\n\nThe practical reality is that this change in law had very little\neffect on school districts. New York City's school construction\nauthority is exempt under current law from compliance with the Wicks\nlaw. For those districts outside of New York City, the spending\nthresholds are too low to capture most construction projects.\n\n\nThis bill would extend to the rest of the state's school districts the\nsame level of exemption currently offered to New York City. In\naddition, this bill would also extend the exemption for the New York\nCity Construction Authority which has had an exemption from Wicks\nsince 1988.\nIndividual exemptions have been made for specific school projects for\nthe Ithaca City School District Niagara Falls School District and the\nBuffalo School District.\n\nIn addition to improving the coordination of the work involved in\nconstruction projects, it is also anticipated that school districts\nwill realize substantial savings between 10 and 30 percent of the\nconstruction cost. The state could also realize savings through this\nbill because construction projects will not require as much\nreimbursement in building aid.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.5559-B/A.8777-B of 2009-2010\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to the State\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n180th day after becoming law.\n\n",
