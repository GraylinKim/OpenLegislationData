Legislative findings and purpose. The legislature finds the\n    2  New York state parks, and natural and cultural lands under state manage-\n    3  ment which began with the Niagara Reservation in  1885  embrace  unique,\n    4  superlative and significant resources. They constitute a major source of\n    5  pride,  inspiration  and  enjoyment of the people of the state, and have\n    6  gained international recognition and acclaim.\n    7    Establishment of the State Council of Parks by the legislature in 1924\n    8  was an act that created the first unified  state  parks  system  in  the\n    9  country.  By  this act and other means the legislature and the people of\n   10  the state have repeatedly expressed their desire that  the  natural  and\n   11  cultural  state  park  resources  of  the  state be accorded the highest\n   12  degree of protection.\n   13    Therefore, it is the purpose of this legislature  to  formally  codify\n   14  the  New York state park system and the identity of the individual units\n   15  thereof.\n   16    S 2. Short title. This act shall be known and may be cited as the \"New\n   17  York state park system act\".\n   18    S 3. The parks, recreation and historic preservation law is amended by\n   19  adding a new article 4 to read as follows:\n   20                                  ARTICLE 4\n   21                         NEW YORK STATE PARK SYSTEM\n   22  SECTION 4.01 STATE PARK SYSTEM.\n   23          4.03 LAND CLASSIFICATION.\n   24          4.05 ADDITIONS TO THE SYSTEM.\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD07940-01-1\n\n       A. 3941                             2\n\n    1    S 4.01 STATE PARK SYSTEM. THE LEGISLATURE DECLARES  THAT  THE  NATURAL\n    2  AND CULTURAL STATE PARK RESOURCES, WHICH BEGAN WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF\n    3  THE  NIAGARA  RESERVATION IN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED EIGHTY-FIVE, HAVE GROWN TO\n    4  INCLUDE SUPERLATIVE NATURAL, HISTORIC AND RECREATIONAL  AREAS  IN  EVERY\n    5  REGION OF THE STATE; THAT THESE AREAS, THOUGH DISTINCT IN CHARACTER, ARE\n    6  UNITED  THROUGH THESE INTERRELATED PURPOSES AND RESOURCES INTO ONE STATE\n    7  PARK SYSTEM AS A CUMULATIVE EXPRESSION OF A SINGLE HERITAGE;  AND  THAT,\n    8  INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY, THESE AREAS DESERVE INCREASED DIGNITY AND\n    9  RECOGNITION  OF  THEIR  SUPERB  ENVIRONMENTAL  QUALITY  AND RECREATIONAL\n   10  POTENTIAL THROUGH THEIR INCLUSION JOINTLY AND WITH  EACH  OTHER  IN  ONE\n   11  STATE  PARK SYSTEM PRESERVED AND MANAGED FOR THE BENEFIT AND INSPIRATION\n   12  OF ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE. THEREFORE, ANY AREA OF  LAND  AND  WATER\n   13  ADMINISTERED  BY  THE  COMMISSIONER  FOR PARK, HISTORIC, PARKWAY, RECRE-\n   14  ATIONAL OR OTHER PURPOSES SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE A PART OF THE STATE PARK\n   15  SYSTEM HEREBY FORMALLY CREATED AND SHALL BE DEEMED TO  BE  PUBLIC  TRUST\n   16  LANDS.

THE\n   21  ADMINISTRATION OF ALL AREAS SHALL BE CONDUCTED  IN  THE  LIGHT  OF  HIGH\n   22  PUBLIC VALUE AND THE INTEGRITY OF THE STATE PARK SYSTEM AND SHALL NOT BE\n   23  EXERCISED IN DEROGATION OF THE VALUES AND PURPOSES FOR WHICH THESE VARI-\n   24  OUS AREAS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED.\n   25    S  4.03  LAND  CLASSIFICATION. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL PROMULGATE RULES\n   26  AND REGULATIONS ESTABLISHING A LAND CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM FOR THE  PRES-\n   27  ERVATION  AND  USE  OF  ALL AREAS OR UNITS WITHIN THE STATE PARK SYSTEM.\n   28  CLASSIFICATIONS SHALL BE IDENTIFIED IN  ORDER  TO  FOSTER  THE  GOAL  OF\n   29  PROTECTION  OF  PARK  RESOURCES, APPROPRIATELY BALANCED WITH THE USE AND\n   30  APPRECIATION OF THOSE  RESOURCES BY VISITORS. ONE  CLASSIFICATION  SHALL\n   31  BE FOR MAXIMUM RESOURCE PROTECTION WHERE RESTRICTED USE MAY BE NECESSARY\n   32  TO  PROTECT SENSITIVE ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS AND CULTURAL AREAS OR RESOURCES\n   33  OF SPECIAL VALUE FOR RESEARCH,  SCIENTIFIC  OR  RELATED  PURPOSES.  EACH\n   34  CLASSIFICATION SHALL INCLUDE A STATEMENT OF APPROPRIATE PROTECTION STAN-\n   35  DARDS.\n   36    S  4.05  ADDITIONS  TO THE SYSTEM. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL INVESTIGATE,\n   37  STUDY AND CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE STATUS  AND  WELFARE  OF  AREAS  WHOSE\n   38  RESOURCES  EXHIBIT  QUALITIES  OF  STATEWIDE SIGNIFICANCE AND WHICH HAVE\n   39  POTENTIAL FOR INCLUSION IN THE STATE PARK SYSTEM. FOR PURPOSES  OF  THIS\n   40  RESPONSIBILITY,  THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL  CONSIDER  THREATS TO RESOURCE\n   41  VALUES, COST ESCALATION FACTORS AND  RELATIONSHIP  TO  THE  NATURAL  AND\n   42  HISTORIC THEMES OF THE STATE. ON OR BEFORE MARCH FIRST OF EACH YEAR, THE\n   43  COMMISSIONER  SHALL REPORT TO THE SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY AND THE TEMPO-\n   44  RARY PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE A LIST OF AREAS THAT  ARE  UNDER  CONSIDER-\n   45  ATION FOR POTENTIAL INCLUSION IN THE STATE PARK SYSTEM.\n   46    S  4. Section 13.03 of the parks, recreation and historic preservation\n   47  law is amended to read as follows:\n   48    S 13.03 Listing of state parks, STATE PARKWAYS,  parkways,  recreation\n   49  facilities  [and],  historic  sites AND ARTIFACTS.   1.
