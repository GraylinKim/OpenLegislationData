  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2168\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to\ncriminal use of public records\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo create a new category of crime for the use of government documents\nfor the purpose of advancing criminal activity.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection one amends the penal law to provide that the use of public\nrecords for the purposes of committing a crime shall be a Class E\nfelony.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) is based on the ideal that \"a free\nsociety is maintained when government is responsive and responsible to\nthe public, and when the public is aware of governmental actions.\" It\nwas this idea of open access to government documents that has,\nunfortunately, come under abuse by convicts and others with questionable\nand/or harmful motives.\nRecently, there has been an increase in instances where unscrupulous\nindividuals use FOIL to gain personal data on unsuspecting citizens. The\ncrime of identity theft is all the more offensive when government\ndocument are used, because the perpetrators are abusing a freedom we all\nenjoy. The use of government documents in this manner is unacceptable\nand should be prevented.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.3962 of 2003-04, Passed Senate both years\nS.1823 of 2005-06, Passed Senate both years\nS.158  of 2007-08, Passed Senate both years\nS.1578 of 2009-10, Referred to Codes\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nNovember 1 next succeeding the date on which it shall have become a law.\n\n",
