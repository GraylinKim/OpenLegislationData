  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1991\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to including within the offense of\npromoting prostitution in the first\ndegree, the prostitution of a child by\na parent, guardian or person charged with the care and custody of the\nchild\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis legislation establishes the crime of promotion of a\nchild less than seventeen years of age by a parent or guardian as a\nclass B felony.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection one creates a class B felony when a\nparent or guardian knowingly advances or profits from the\nprostitution of a child less than seventeen years of age he or she is\ncharged with caring for.\n\nSection two establishes the effective date of this law as November 1\nafter the bill becomes law.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nCurrently, there is no statute that specifically\naddresses the prostitution of a child by a parent or guardian.\nCurrent offenses of promoting child prostitution range from class D\nto class B felonies.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nRecent cases in New York have indicated a need to\naddress the promoting of child prostitution by parents. Perpetrators\nof these despicable acts should be treated appropriately, ensuring\nthey are unable to have access to the children they exploited.\n\nPenalties for child prostitution offenses remain largely the same as\nwhen they were when first defined in 1978. These penalties do not\nadequately reflect the seriousness of crimes involving the\nprostitution of our children, particularly when the perpetrator is\nthe parent or legal guardian of the child.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2007-2008: S.5879 - Referred to Codes\n2009-2010: S.2114 - Referred to Codes\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nNovember 1 after it becomes law.\n\n",
