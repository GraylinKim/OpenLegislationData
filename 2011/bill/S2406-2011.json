  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2406\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the education law, the business corporation law, the limited\nliability company law and the partnership law, in relation to\nproviding for the licensing of the profession of geology\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo establish the practice of geology as a licensed profession\nin the State of New York and to establish standards of education and\nexperience as a prerequisite to licensure.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThe bill amends the Education Law by adding six\nnew sections to establish a system of licensure for geologists\npracticing in the State of New York.\nThe general provisions for all professions contained in Article 130 of\nthe Education Law shall apply to this Article. Geologists meeting the\nrequirements of education, and experience and who pass a standardized\nexamination, may become licensed by the New York State Education\nDepartment as Professional Geologists.\n\nThe bill expands the combined state board for engineering and land\nsurveying to include geology for the purpose of assisting the Board\nof Regents and the Education Department on matters of professional\nlicensing and professional conduct.\n\nThe bill exempts from its requirements the practice of professional\nengineer and the practice of professional land surveying by those\nduly licensed in the State of New York. The bill also amends the\nBusiness Corporation Law and the Limited Liability Company Law to\nauthorize licensed geologists to join with licensed engineers, land\nsurveyors, architects and landscape architects in the formation of\njoint enterprise, partnership, professional service corporation or a\nprofessional service limited liability company, or any combination\nthereof.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nRendering scientific expert opinion regarding\ngeological conditions to State or local government agencies and the\npublic can have significant impact on the environmental quality of\nNew York State and on the safety, property and well-being of its\ncitizens. Geologists routinely conduct investigations and provide\ninterpretive geologic services related to the development and\nprotection of groundwater resources, the subsurface disposal of\nhazardous wastes and the potential for migration of contamination.\n\nThere are currently twenty-four states, including California,\nIllinois, Florida and Pennsylvania that require licensure of\n\ngeologists. This bill adds geologists to the list of professionals\ncurrently licensed by the State Education Department.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.1116 of 2009-2010\nS.5307-B of 2007-2008, Passed Senate\nS.3114-A of 2005-2006, Passed Senate\nS.2174-B of 2003-2004, Passed Senate\nS.2383-F of 2001-2002, Passed Senate\nS.3263 of 1999-2000\nS.5996 of 1998\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nThe State Education Department estimates the cost\nto implement this legislation would be $155,000, to be supported by\nlicensure fees.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect three\nyears after the date on which it shall have become a law.\n\n",
