Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as\n    2  the \"Increasing Diversity in Higher Education Act of 2011\".\n    3    S  2.  Legislative intent. The legislature hereby finds that the state\n    4  university of New York has not fully met the growing  demand  placed  on\n    5  the  university  system  to  train  the next generation workforce of our\n    6  state.  Simultaneously,  the  university  system  is   faced   with   an\n    7  unprecedented  rate  of minority and low-income student enrollment, high\n    8  rates of student dropouts, larger numbers of students completing college\n    9  after six years or more, and a situation where only 32 out of 100  white\n   10  students and only 11 of every 100 Hispanic and African-American students\n   11  are  graduating  from  college. The economic impact on our state and the\n   12  nation of these dynamics are  tremendously  negative  and  threaten  the\n   13  fabric of our civil society and national security.\n   14    Over the past decade, the state university of New York has experienced\n   15  a  steady rise in the number of traditionally underrepresented students.\n   16  By the year 2015, figures from the United States census and  other  data\n   17  indicate  that  the  majority  of New York high school graduates will be\n   18  from groups that have been historically underrepresented in  SUNY.  This\n   19  demographic  shift  and a need to train a competitive New York workforce\n   20  present public higher education policy makers with a  challenge.  It  is\n   21  clear that New York must reduce educational inequities faced by minority\n   22  and  low-income  students  from  historically  marginalized groups while\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD00027-01-1\n\n       A. 2335                             2\n\n    1  simultaneously maintaining the highest of  educational  standards.  This\n    2  huge  demographic change must be addressed by policy makers as the state\n    3  university of New York is not prepared to increase the academic achieve-\n    4  ment and educational attainment of historically marginalized groups.\n    5    Data  compiled  on  college  access  and success show that New York is\n    6  doing better than most states for those 25 years of age  and  older  but\n    7  not  for  younger, low-income and fastest growing populations. According\n    8  to 2009 data compiled by the Education Trust, New York's four-year grad-\n    9  uation rate for African-Americans is  22  percent  and  17  percent  for\n   10  Hispanics.    The  six-year  graduation rate more than doubles, however,\n   11  most of these students will have compromised their academic  achievement\n   12  and  dramatically  reduced  their opportunities to pursue post-secondary\n   13  education based on their low grades.\n   14    The percentage  of  individuals  from  traditionally  underrepresented\n   15  groups  who are attending SUNY is lower given their numbers in the state\n   16  population. Consequently, any initiatives designed to maximize access to\n   17  affordable, quality education should make  special  efforts  to  recruit\n   18  students  from  these  underserved sectors of the state's population. In\n   19  its official publications SUNY recognizes its responsibility to employ a\n   20  workforce and educate a student  body  that  is  representative  of  the\n   21  state's  population.  However,  SUNY  has  not  been able to recruit and\n   22  retain  senior  administrators,  faculty,  graduate  and   undergraduate\n   23  students  in  sufficient numbers to overcome the long-standing under-re-\n   24  presentation of people of color.\n   25    For example, the Hispanic population of New York grew by 33.1  percent\n   26  between  1990  and  2000,  and made up 15.1 percent of the state's popu-\n   27  lation. By 2006, Hispanics made up 16.1 percent  of  the  state's  popu-\n   28  lation.  Yet,  Hispanics  accounted for only five percent of the student\n   29  population in the state-operated/funded campuses of SUNY.  African-Amer-\n   30  icans are also underrepresented in SUNY, although their percentages  are\n   31  better  than  those  for  Hispanics.  In  2006, 14,737 African-Americans\n   32  attended SUNY state-operated/funded campuses, and  accounted  for  seven\n   33  percent  of  the  student  population.  African-Americans comprised 17.4\n   34  percent of the state's population in 2006. As is the case  with  Hispan-\n   35  ics, Blacks are also seriously underrepresented in the SUNY campuses.\n   36    The  figures  on African-Americans and Hispanic student enrollments in\n   37  SUNY  universities  and  colleges  are  consistent  with  the   findings\n   38  published  in  an  Education Trust study of public flagship universities\n   39  that documents disproportionate under-representation of  low-income  and\n   40  minority students. The report observes that flagship public universities\n   41  are  failing to make progress \"in better serving the vast breadth of our\n   42  citizenry.\" New York state should provide SUNY  with  the  resources  to\n   43  implement  effective strategies and best practices, so that it can stand\n   44  as an exception to this discouraging national  trend  in  public  higher\n   45  education.\n   46    The  problem  is  just  as  acute within African-American and Hispanic\n   47  representation in the faculty ranks of the state-operated/funded campus-\n   48  es which also fail to reflect the composition of the state's population.\n   49  In the doctoral institutions the percentages for  full  time  Black  and\n   50  Hispanic  employees  are 14.9 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively. For\n   51  the research university centers the figures are 6.8 percent  African-Am-\n   52  erican  and  2.4 percent Latino. An analysis of Hispanic faculty employ-\n   53  ment by a member of the New York state assembly recently  revealed  that\n   54  SUNY  lags substantially behind the state's private universities and the\n   55  city university of New York in the number of Hispanics in its full  time\n   56  professional ranks.\n\n       A. 2335                             3\n\n    1    It  is  the  finding  of  this legislature that in order for the state\n    2  university of New York to address the problems cited above, the  univer-\n    3  sity  system must engage in a system-wide effort to increase faculty and\n    4  student diversity and improve its student success  rates.  In  order  to\n    5  begin such work, SUNY must put in place a vice chancellor for the office\n    6  of  diversity  and  educational  equity  who will report directly to the\n    7  chancellor. Just as major public and private university  systems  across\n    8  the  United  States  have  hired  and provided substantial resources and\n    9  authority to a chief diversity officer, SUNY must  follow  the  lead  of\n   10  these  successful  university  and  college  programs in order to remain\n   11  competitive and fulfill its mission of training New York's future  work-\n   12  force, while also improving the economic outlook for all the communities\n   13  it is entrusted to serve.\n   14    S  3.  The  opening  paragraph  of subdivision 1 of section 352 of the\n   15  education law is designated paragraph a and a new paragraph b  is  added\n   16  to read as follows:\n   17    B.  (1) THERE IS HEREBY ESTABLISHED AN OFFICE FOR DIVERSITY AND EDUCA-\n   18  TIONAL EQUITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY. SUCH OFFICE\n   19  SHALL BE ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE UNIVERSITY TRUSTEES AND  SHALL  ADVISE\n   20  THE TRUSTEES AND THE CHANCELLOR ON ISSUES RELATED TO INCREASING FACULTY,\n   21  STAFF  AND STUDENT DIVERSITY IN THE STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM AND ENSURING\n   22  EDUCATIONAL EQUITY IN THE STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM.    THE  HEAD  OF  THE\n   23  OFFICE  FOR  DIVERSITY AND EDUCATIONAL EQUITY SHALL BE A VICE CHANCELLOR\n   24  WHO SHALL REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE CHANCELLOR  OF  THE  STATE  UNIVERSITY.\n   25  FURTHERMORE, THERE SHALL BE INCLUDED IN THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK\n   26  BUDGET  PROPOSAL  TO  THE  GOVERNOR AND TO THE DIVISION OF THE BUDGET AN\n   27  APPROPRIATION FOR EACH STATE FISCAL YEAR TO FUND AND SUPPORT THE  OPERA-\n   28  TION OF THE OFFICE FOR DIVERSITY AND EDUCATIONAL EQUITY.\n   29    (2)  THE  VICE  CHANCELLOR OF THE OFFICE FOR DIVERSITY AND EDUCATIONAL\n   30  EQUITY SHALL ANNUALLY, ON OR BEFORE JANUARY FIRST, SUBMIT  A  REPORT  TO\n   31  THE  GOVERNOR  AND  THE  LEGISLATURE  DETAILING  THE  CURRENT EFFORTS TO\n   32  INCREASE DIVERSITY AS THEY RELATE TO THE HIRING AND EMPLOYMENT OF FACUL-\n   33  TY AND STUDENT ENROLLMENT AT ALL CAMPUSES OF THE COLLEGES AND  UNIVERSI-\n   34  TIES OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK. SUCH REPORT SHALL INCLUDE, BUT\n   35  NOT BE LIMITED TO:\n   36    (I) MINORITY ENROLLMENT AT EACH CAMPUS;\n   37    (II) MINORITY WITHDRAWALS AND DISMISSALS AT EACH CAMPUS;\n   38    (III) THE SIZE OF THE MINORITY FRESHMAN CLASS AT EACH CAMPUS;\n   39    (IV)  THE  NUMBERS  OF  MINORITIES WHO GRADUATE AFTER FOUR YEARS, FIVE\n   40  YEARS AND SIX YEARS AT EACH CAMPUS;\n   41    (V) THE NUMBER OF FACULTY  POSITIONS  FILLED  BY  MINORITIES  AT  EACH\n   42  CAMPUS; AND\n   43    (VI)  THE  NUMBER  OF MINORITY FACULTY HIRED BY EACH CAMPUS, AND THEIR\n   44  SALARY RATE AND TITLE.\n   45    ALL INFORMATION SHALL BE FURTHER BROKEN DOWN  BY  CAMPUS,  GENDER  AND\n   46  ETHNICITY.\n   47    S 4.
