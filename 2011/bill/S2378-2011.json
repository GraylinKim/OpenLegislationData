  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2378\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the alcoholic beverage control law, in relation to providing a\nmultiple event caterer's permit\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo provide for a multiple event caterer's permit.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nCurrent law requires caterers to apply for a separate\npermit for each function.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nUnder current law, Section 9R of the Alcoholic\nBeverage Control Law provides that caterers must apply to the State\nLiquor Authority for a permit each time that they wish to serve\nalcoholic beverages for a function or occasion at a hotel.\nrestaurant, club, ballroom or other premises. Having to apply for a\npermit for each function can be extremely burdensome for caterers who\nmake their living providing food and beverages at various locations.\nThis bill would facilitate operations for caterers, many of which are\nsmall businesses, and would reduce the number of caterer's permit\napplications which the State Liquor Authority would be required to\nreview.\n\nCaterers with a multiple event caterer's permit would be required to\nprovide the State Liquor Authority with information, as specified by\nthe Liquor Authority, regarding each function or event that the\ncaterer plans to serve at least five business days prior to each\nfunction or event. The annual fee for a multiple event caterer's\npermit would be $250\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.3058 of 2009-10; S.7471-A of 2008.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n180 days after becoming a law.\n\n",
