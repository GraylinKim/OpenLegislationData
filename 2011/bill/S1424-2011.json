  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1424\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the elder law, in relation to establishing an intergenerational\neducational and mentoring service program\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF THE BILL:\nEstablish a statewide intergenerational educational and mentoring\nservice program to tap the expertise, experience and knowledge of\nolder adults and encourage their volunteerism in schools.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nAmends the elder law by adding a new Article IV to read\nintergenerational educational and mentoring service program.\nSection 301 contains definitions.\nSection 302 establishes local intergenerational educational\nand mentoring service programs.\nSection 303 outlines the duties of the director.\nSection 304 details grant funding, based on appropriations.\nSection 305 describes the reporting requirements.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nMany older New Yorkers who retire do not wish to sit idle. Many are\nlooking to continue to work in some capacity, or to find volunteer\nopportunities that are meaningful. This legislation provides a\nmechanism to do a number of things. First, it provides an opportunity\nfor older adults to work directly with children helping them in\nschool to increase their ability to learn and by being mentors.\nSecond, it provides the classrooms with additional help. Third, it\nprovides children with an opportunity to be close to and learn from\nolder adults, who have a lifetimes worth of knowledge and experience\nand the desire to be engaged with the children in a volunteer\ncapacity. Fourth, it provides an opportunity for children who may\nneed extra help or are struggling in schools to gain one-on-one\nattention and extra help, providing them with increased self-esteem\nand the ability to learn and excel. And finally, bridging the\ngenerations provides a benefit to the older adult and to the child.\nThe older adult stays connected in the community and less likely to\nwant to move out of state. The older adult is able to give back to\nthe community in a meaningful way. The child has exposure to older\npeople and can learn from them, interact with them and have\na better understanding of being older.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.3059 -  2007: Referred to Aging, Reported and Committed to Finance\nS.3059A - 2008: Referred to Aging, Reported and Committed to Finance\nS.2018A - 2009: Referred to Aging, Reported and Committed to Finance\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nOne hundred and eightieth day after it shall have become law.\n\n",
