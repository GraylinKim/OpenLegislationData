Amends subdivision 4 of section 467-b of the Real Property\nTax Law, as amended by chapter 651 of the laws of 1988. Requires that\nthe appropriate rent control agency or administrative agency shall\nsend a notice of required renewal to each head of household receiving\nSCRIE via US Mail no less than 30 days prior to expiration.\n\nSection 2. Amends subdivision 4 of section 467-6 of the Real Property\nTax Law, as added by chapter 689 of the laws of 1972. Requires that\nthe appropriate rent control agency or administrative agency shall\nsend a notice of required renewal to each head of household receiving\nSCRIE via US Mail no less than 30 days prior to expiration.\n\nSection 3. Effective Date.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nNone.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption Program provides much\nneeded assistance to senior citizens in New York City by\nsupplementing their rent payments, thereby keeping them in their\nhomes and out of nursing homes. When this program was initially\ninstituted it was administered by the New York City Department for\nthe Aging. The administration of the SCRIE program has beep.\ntransferred to the Finance Department, which does not have the\ncapacity to assist seniors in\nthe application and renewal process for this program. As a result many\nrecipients have missed their renewal deadlines and have been forced\nto endure reapplication processes and in some cases a suspension of\nbenefits.\n\nThis bill is designed to make the renewal process simpler by putting\nin place a mechanism to remind eligible seniors to renew their\nbenefits before they expire.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010: S.6853 - Passed Senate/A.9932 - Reported Referred to Ways and Means\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to the State of New York.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect 90 days after it shall have become law;\nprovided that the amendments to section 467-b of the real property tax\n\n\nlaw made by section one of this act shall be subject to the expiration\nand reversion of such section pursuant to section 17 of chapter 576\nof the laws of 1974, as amended, when upon such date the\nprovisions of section two of this act shall take effect.\n\n",
