  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1454\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the environmental conservation law, in relation to determining\nmunicipality responsibility for hazardous waste remedial programs\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nThis bill exempts municipalities from the responsibility for hazardous\nwaste remedial programs for properties which they acquired through\nescheat, involuntary transfer, condemnation, or eminent domain, if\nthe municipality did not contribute to the wastes found on the site.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nThis bill amends the state Superfund Program, Section 27-1313 of the\nEnvironmental Conservation Law. This bill would exempt municipalities\nfrom financial responsibility for remedial action on property which\nthey received title through escheat, involuntary transfer or\nacquisition, eminent domain purchase or condemnation, unless the\nmunicipality participated in the generation, transportation, or\ndisposal of the hazardous wastes or substances located on the property.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\n\nThis bill would codify in New York State Law the exemption offered to\nmunicipalities in the Federal Superfund Law (CERC-LA, Comprehensive\nEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act) for fiscal\nresponsibility for contaminated property remediation.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nAs properties contaminated with hazardous wastes and substances lose\ntheir resale value many land owners allow the contaminated property\nto be claimed by municipalities to payoff their tax liability and to\ndispose of the property. This leaves many municipalities throughout\nthe state\nowning and being responsible for numerous contaminated properties. The\ncurrent State Superfund program requires responsible parties to\nremediate the hazardous wastes found on the site. The law defines\nresponsible parties as any entity that generated, transported or\ndisposed of the wastes at the site and the current land owner. If a\nmunicipality was not involved with the generation, transportation, or\ndisposal of the waste on the site, it should not be held responsible\nfor the clean-up of lands they received through the default of taxes.\nThe original owners of the land and generators of the wastes should\nbe responsible for the remediation of the site, not the taxpayers of\na community that did not contribute to the contamination.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\nS.228  2009-10\nS.663  2007-08\nS.1335 2005-06\nS.754  2003-04\nS.1426 2001-02\nS.2460 1999-00\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
