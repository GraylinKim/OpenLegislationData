  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2458\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to criminal destruction\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo specify that willful and knowing destruction of an\nexperimental research crop is criminal destruction.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nAmends the Penal Law by adding two new sections on criminal\ndestruction. A person is guilty of criminal destruction in the second\ndegree when he or she willfully and knowingly damages or destroys any\nfield crop product that is grown for personal or commercial purposes,\nor for testing or research purposes in the context of a product\ndevelopment program in conjunction or coordination with a private\nresearch facility or a university or any federal, state, or local\ngovernment agency. If the value of such field crop product is greater\nthan ten thousand dollars based on the market value of the crop prior\nto the damage or destruction, and production, research, testing,\nreplacement, and crop development costs directly related to the crop\nthat has been damaged or destroyed as part of the value of the crop,\nthen such person is guilty of criminal destruction in the first\ndegree. Criminal destruction in the second degree is a class E felony\nand in the first degree is a class D felony.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nOver the past two to three years there has been a serious rise in\ndomestic terrorism by groups who vandalize or destroy property for a\n\"political cause\". The attacks of these extremists are especially\nalarming to agricultural and higher education communities.\nAgricultural research takes significant investment and the\ndestruction of a research crop may cause for more serious damage than\nis reflected by the market value of the crop in the field. For\nexample, a graduate student's three year doctoral project was\ndestroyed in an attack at UC-Davis that appeared to be\nindiscriminate, with 85% of the damaged crops being crops that were\ntraditionally bred.\nSimilarly, in July of 2000 vandals chopped down acres of corn at Cold\nSpring Harbor Laboratory destroying two years of genetic experiments\nthat were the result of natural plant breeding, not genetic\nmodification. These acts of destruction are criminal acts, regardless\nof their supposed political purpose. The penal law should recognize\nthe seriousness of these acts, and needs a\nspecific mechanism to calculate the value to the researcher of these\nfield crops. This legislation provides that mechanism.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.996  of 2009-2010\nS.1556 of 2007-2008\n\nS.1486 of 2005-2006\nS.884  of 2003-2004\nS.4756 of 2001-2002\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nFirst day of November next succeeding enactment.\n\n",
