AUBRY -- read once and referred to the Committee\n         on Correction\n\n       AN ACT creating a temporary New York state commission  on  sex  offender\n         supervision  and  management  and  providing  for  the  repeal of such\n         provisions upon expiration thereof\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section  1.  Legislative  findings  and intent. The legislature hereby\n    2  finds and declares that persons convicted of a  sex  offense  present  a\n    3  danger  to  the  public.  It  is  necessary that these offenders receive\n    4  appropriate supervision and treatment designed to  reduce  the  risk  of\n    5  re-offense  in  order  to  ensure  the safety, health and welfare of the\n    6  communities in which convicted sex  offenders  reside.  The  legislature\n    7  further  finds  that  New York's state prison system does not adequately\n    8  prepare inmates for a safe return to the community upon  the  completion\n    9  of  their  sentence.  Lack  of  treatment during incarceration creates a\n   10  threat to public  safety  by  increasing  the  likelihood  that  inmates\n   11  released to the community will be unable to successfully transition back\n   12  to society and therefore heightens the risk of re-offense. This is espe-\n   13  cially  true for sex offenders who often do not find appropriate housing\n   14  and treatment programs  in  the  community.  Further,  the  division  of\n   15  parole,  local  probation  departments  and social services agencies are\n   16  often unable to locate suitable housing  for  convicted  sex  offenders.\n   17  This  lack  of  housing has resulted in an unacceptable level of concen-\n   18  tration of sex offenders in certain residential areas.\n   19    S 2. A temporary state commission, to be known as the New  York  state\n   20  commission  on  sex  offender  supervision  and  management, hereinafter\n   21  referred to as the commission, is hereby created to  examine,  evaluate,\n   22  and  make  recommendations  concerning  the  effectiveness  of  programs\n   23  involving inmates who are required to register as a sex offender  pursu-\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD01203-01-1\n\n       A. 691                              2\n\n    1  ant  to  article 6-C of the correction law released from state and local\n    2  correctional facilities.  The commission shall investigate  all  factors\n    3  that impact the risk of recidivism, and lead to the concentration of sex\n    4  offenders in certain residential areas. The commission shall analyze the\n    5  impact  of existing policies and practices and compare such policies and\n    6  practices of this state to those of other states and the federal govern-\n    7  ment. The commission shall collect data from state and federal  agencies\n    8  and  may  analyze  any current research deemed relevant and appropriate.\n    9  Specifically, the commission shall examine at least the following:\n   10    (a) the existence of concentrations of  registered  sex  offenders  in\n   11  certain  residential areas and municipalities and the circumstances that\n   12  caused such concentrations to exist;\n   13    (b) the practices and procedures of  the  division  of  parole,  local\n   14  probation departments and local social services districts in investigat-\n   15  ing and approving residences for convicted sex offenders;\n   16    (c)  the  availability of appropriate housing for convicted sex offen-\n   17  ders;\n   18    (d) the adequacy of  supervision  and  monitoring  of  registered  sex\n   19  offenders  under  the supervision of the division of parole or serving a\n   20  sentence of probation; and\n   21    (e) the effectiveness and availability of existing sex offender treat-\n   22  ment programs  and  the  need  for  additional  sex  offender  treatment\n   23  programs in prison, local correctional facilities and the community.\n   24    S 3. The commission shall consist of thirteen members, to be appointed\n   25  as  follows:  three members shall be appointed by the governor, one each\n   26  from the department of correctional services, the  division  of  parole,\n   27  and  the  division  of  probation  and  correctional  alternatives;  six\n   28  members, with three appointments  by  the  temporary  president  of  the\n   29  senate and three by the speaker of the assembly, shall be representative\n   30  of community-based providers of employment, education, housing and other\n   31  services  used by individuals returning to society from prison, criminal\n   32  justice advocates, victim advocacy groups, and academic professionals in\n   33  the field of criminal justice; one member  shall  be  appointed  by  the\n   34  minority  leader of the senate; and one member shall be appointed by the\n   35  minority leader of the assembly.

The  vice-chairperson of the\n   40  commission shall be a  representative  of  one  of  the  community-based\n   41  organizations and appointed by the chairperson. Vacancies in the member-\n   42  ship  of  the  commission  and among its officers shall be filled in the\n   43  manner provided for original appointments or designations.\n   44    S 4. The members of the commission shall receive no  compensation  for\n   45  their services, but shall be allowed their actual and necessary expenses\n   46  incurred  in  the  performance of their duties hereunder. To the maximum\n   47  extent feasible, the commission shall be entitled to request and receive\n   48  and shall utilize and be provided with such facilities,  resources,  and\n   49  data  of  any court, department, division, board, bureau, commission, or\n   50  agency of the state or any political subdivision  thereof  as  it  deems\n   51  necessary or desirable to carry out properly its powers and duties here-\n   52  under.\n   53    S  5.
