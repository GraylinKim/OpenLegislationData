Subdivision 1 of section 103 of the general municipal law,\n    2  as amended by section 1 of part FF of chapter 56 of the laws of 2010, is\n    3  amended to read as follows:\n    4    1. Except as otherwise expressly provided by an act of the legislature\n    5  or by a local law adopted prior to  September  first,  nineteen  hundred\n    6  fifty-three,  all  contracts for public work involving an expenditure of\n    7  more than  thirty-five  thousand  dollars  and  all  purchase  contracts\n    8  involving  an expenditure of more than twenty thousand dollars, shall be\n    9  awarded by the appropriate officer,  board  or  agency  of  a  political\n   10  subdivision  or  of  any district therein including but not limited to a\n   11  soil conservation district, to the lowest responsible bidder  furnishing\n   12  the  required security after advertisement for sealed bids in the manner\n   13  provided by this section. In any case where a responsible bidder's gross\n   14  price is reducible by an allowance for  the  value  of  used  machinery,\n   15  equipment,  apparatus  or  tools to be traded in by a political subdivi-\n   16  sion, the gross price shall be reduced by the amount of such  allowance,\n   17  for  the  purpose of determining the low bid. In cases where two or more\n   18  responsible bidders furnishing the required  security  submit  identical\n   19  bids  as  to price, such officer, board or agency may award the contract\n   20  to any of such bidders. Such officer, board or agency may, in his or her\n   21  or its discretion, reject all bids and readvertise for new bids  in  the\n   22  manner  provided by this section; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IN THE CITY OF\n   23  ROCHESTER, FOR PUBLIC WORKS AND PURCHASE CONTRACTS  UP  TO  ONE  HUNDRED\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD03864-01-1\n\n       A. 820                              2\n\n    1  THOUSAND  DOLLARS,  SUCH  CONTRACTS  MAY  BE  AWARDED TO THE RESPONSIBLE\n    2  BIDDER WHOSE BID IS WITHIN FIVE PERCENT OF THE BID OF THE LOWEST RESPON-\n    3  SIBLE BIDDER, IF THE PRINCIPAL PLACE  OF  BUSINESS  OF  SUCH  BIDDER  IS\n    4  LOCATED  WITHIN THE ROCHESTER METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA, SUCH BIDDER\n    5  IS CERTIFIED BY THE STATE OF NEW YORK AS A MINORITY OR WOMEN-OWNED BUSI-\n    6  NESS AND SUCH AWARD IS MADE PURSUANT TO A MINORITY/WOMEN BUSINESS ENTER-\n    7  PRISE PROGRAM LAWFULLY ADOPTED BY THE CITY OF ROCHESTER.  In determining\n    8  whether a purchase is an expenditure within the discretionary  threshold\n    9  amounts established by this subdivision, the officer, board or agency of\n   10  a  political  subdivision  or of any district therein shall consider the\n   11  reasonably expected aggregate  amount  of  all  purchases  of  the  same\n   12  commodities,  services  or technology to be made within the twelve-month\n   13  period commencing on the date of purchase.   Purchases  of  commodities,\n   14  services or technology shall not be artificially divided for the purpose\n   15  of  satisfying  the  discretionary buying thresholds established by this\n   16  subdivision. A change to or a renewal of a discretionary purchase  shall\n   17  not  be  permitted  if  the change or renewal would bring the reasonably\n   18  expected aggregate amount of all  purchases  of  the  same  commodities,\n   19  services  or  technology  from the same provider within the twelve-month\n   20  period commencing on the date of the first purchase to an amount greater\n   21  than the discretionary buying threshold amount.  For  purposes  of  this\n   22  section,  \"sealed  bids\",  as  that  term applies to purchase contracts,\n   23  shall  include  bids  submitted  in  an  electronic   format   including\n   24  submission  of  the  statement  of non-collusion required by section one\n   25  hundred three-d of this article, provided that the  governing  board  of\n   26  the political subdivision or district, by resolution, has authorized the\n   27  receipt  of  bids  in such format.  Submission in electronic format may,\n   28  for technology contracts only, be required as the sole  method  for  the\n   29  submission  of  bids.  Bids  submitted  in an electronic format shall be\n   30  transmitted by bidders to the receiving device designated by  the  poli-\n   31  tical  subdivision  or  district.  Any method used to receive electronic\n   32  bids shall comply with article three of the state  technology  law,  and\n   33  any  rules  and  regulations promulgated and guidelines developed there-\n   34  under and, at a minimum, must (a) document the time and date of  receipt\n   35  of  each  bid  received electronically; (b) authenticate the identity of\n   36  the sender; (c) ensure the security of the information transmitted;  and\n   37  (d) ensure the confidentiality of the bid until the time and date estab-\n   38  lished  for  the opening of bids. The timely submission of an electronic\n   39  bid in compliance with instructions provided for such submission in  the\n   40  advertisement  for bids and/or the specifications shall be the responsi-\n   41  bility solely of each bidder or prospective bidder. No political  subdi-\n   42  vision  or  district therein shall incur any liability from delays of or\n   43  interruptions in the receiving device designated for the submission  and\n   44  receipt of electronic bids.\n   45    S  2.  This act shall take effect immediately; provided, however, that\n   46  the amendments to subdivision 1 of section 103 of the general  municipal\n   47  law  made  by section one of this act shall not affect the expiration of\n   48  such subdivision and shall be deemed to expire therewith.\n",
