PARKER, LITTLE, VALESKY -- read twice and ordered\n         printed, and when printed to be committed to the Committee on Health\n\n       AN ACT to amend the public health law, the tax law and the state finance\n         law, in relation to providing for taxpayer gifts for  lupus  education\n         and  prevention,  and  establishing the lupus education and prevention\n         fund and outreach program\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds the\n    2  following:\n    3    (a) Lupus is a serious, complex, debilitating autoimmune disease  that\n    4  can  cause  inflammation and tissue damage to virtually any organ system\n    5  in the body, including the skin, joints, other connective tissue,  blood\n    6  and blood vessels, heart, lungs, kidney, and brain.\n    7    (b)  Lupus research estimates that approximately one and a half to two\n    8  million Americans live with some form of lupus; lupus affects women nine\n    9  times more often than men and eighty percent of newly diagnosed cases of\n   10  lupus develop among women of childbearing age.\n   11    (c) Lupus disproportionately affects women of color -- it  is  two  to\n   12  three  times  more common among African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians and\n   13  Native Americans and is generally more prevalent in minority populations\n   14  -- a health disparity that remains unexplained. According to the Centers\n   15  for Disease Control and Prevention  the  rate  of  lupus  mortality  has\n   16  increased  since the late 1970s and is higher among older African-Ameri-\n   17  can women.\n   18    (d) No new drugs have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis-\n   19  tration specifically for lupus in nearly forty years and  while  current\n   20  treatments  for  the disease can be effective, they can lead to damaging\n   21  side effects.\n   22    (e) The pain and fatigue associated with lupus can  threaten  people's\n   23  ability  to live independently, make it difficult to maintain employment\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD00228-01-1\n\n       S. 1175                             2\n\n    1  and lead normal lives, and one in five people with lupus is disabled  by\n    2  the disease, and consequently receives support from government programs,\n    3  including  Medicare,  Medicaid,  social  security disability, and social\n    4  security supplemental income.\n    5    (f)  The  estimated  average  annual  cost of medical treatment for an\n    6  individual with lupus can range between ten thousand dollars and  thirty\n    7  thousand  dollars;  for  people who have the most serious form of lupus,\n    8  medical costs can greatly exceed  this  amount,  causing  a  significant\n    9  economic, emotional and social burden to the entire family and society.\n   10    (g)  More than half of the people with lupus suffer four or more years\n   11  and visit three or more  physicians  before  obtaining  a  diagnosis  of\n   12  lupus;  early  diagnosis  of and commencement of treatment for lupus can\n   13  prevent or reduce serious organ damage, disability, and death.\n   14    (h) Despite the magnitude of lupus and its impact on  individuals  and\n   15  families,  health professional and public understanding of lupus remains\n   16  low; only one of five Americans can provide even basic information about\n   17  lupus, and awareness of lupus is lowest among adults  ages  eighteen  to\n   18  thirty-four -- the age group most likely to develop symptoms of lupus.\n   19    (i)  Lupus  is  a  significant  national  health issue that deserves a\n   20  comprehensive and coordinated response by state and federal  governments\n   21  with involvement of the health care provider, patient, and public health\n   22  communities.\n   23    S  2. Subdivision 1 of section 207 of the public health law is amended\n   24  by adding a new paragraph (i) to read as follows:\n   25    (I) THE DANGERS OF, INCLUDING WAYS TO PREVENT THE INCIDENCE AND SEVER-\n   26  ITY OF, LUPUS, A DEBILITATING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE THAT CAN CAUSE  INFLAM-\n   27  MATION  AND  TISSUE  DAMAGE  TO  VIRTUALLY ANY ORGAN SYSTEM IN THE BODY,\n   28  INCLUDING THE SKIN, JOINTS, OTHER CONNECTIVE  TISSUE,  BLOOD  AND  BLOOD\n   29  VESSELS, HEART, LUNG, KIDNEY AND BRAIN, AND WHICH AFFECTS WOMEN, PARTIC-\n   30  ULARLY  WOMEN  OF COLOR, IN A DISPROPORTIONATE MANNER; PROVIDED THAT THE\n   31  PROGRAM SHALL INCLUDE AN ADVISORY COUNCIL UNDER THIS SECTION THAT  SHALL\n   32  INCLUDE  REPRESENTATIVES  OF  PEOPLE  WITH  LUPUS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND\n   33  HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHO SPECIALIZE IN TREATING LUPUS, AMONG OTHERS.\n   34    S 3.   Subdivision 7 of section 207  of  the  public  health  law,  as\n   35  amended  by  section 16 of part A of chapter 109 of the laws of 2010, is\n   36  amended to read as follows:\n   37    7. In addition to state funds appropriated  for  programs  under  this\n   38  section,  the  commissioner  may  accept  grants  from public or private\n   39  sources for these programs.  The  commissioner,  in  administering  this\n   40  section,  shall  seek to coordinate the department's programs with other\n   41  public and private programs, and  may  undertake  joint  or  cooperative\n   42  programs  with other public or private entities, INCLUDING MAKING GRANTS\n   43  (WITHIN AMOUNTS APPROPRIATED THEREFOR  AND  CONSISTENT  WITH  APPLICABLE\n   44  LAW) TO PUBLIC OR NOT-FOR-PROFIT ENTITIES.\n   45    S  4.  The tax law is amended by adding a new section 209-H to read as\n   46  follows:\n   47    S 209-H. GIFT FOR LUPUS EDUCATION AND PREVENTION. A  TAXPAYER  IN  ANY\n   48  TAXABLE  YEAR MAY ELECT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUPPORT OF THE LUPUS EDUCA-\n   49  TION AND PREVENTION FUND.

NOTWITH-\n   53  STANDING  ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW, ALL REVENUES COLLECTED PURSUANT TO\n   54  THIS SECTION SHALL BE CREDITED TO THE  LUPUS  EDUCATION  AND  PREVENTION\n   55  FUND  AND  SHALL  BE  USED ONLY FOR THOSE PURPOSES ENUMERATED IN SECTION\n   56  NINETY-SEVEN-KKKK OF THE STATE FINANCE LAW.\n\n       S. 1175                             3\n\n    1    S 5.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANY\n    9  OTHER PROVISION OF LAW ALL REVENUES COLLECTED PURSUANT TO  THIS  SECTION\n   10  SHALL  BE  CREDITED  TO THE LUPUS EDUCATION AND PREVENTION FUND AND USED\n   11  ONLY FOR THOSE PURPOSES ENUMERATED IN SECTION NINETY-SEVEN-KKKK  OF  THE\n   12  STATE FINANCE LAW.\n   13    S  6. The state finance law is amended by adding a new section 97-kkkk\n   14  to read as follows:\n   15    S 97-KKKK. LUPUS EDUCATION AND PREVENTION FUND.  1.
