  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1240\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the vehicle and traffic law, in relation to the sale of tires\n\nPURPOSE:\nThe purpose of this bill is to significantly reduce accidents caused\nby tire failure through consumer awareness.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSubdivision 35 of section 375 of the vehicle and traffic law is\namended by adding a new paragraph (d) which states that no tire shall\nbe distributed, sold or offered for sale in this state unless a label\nor sticker determined by the Commissioner is affixed to such tire\nclearly displaying the manufacturer and the date of creation of such\ntire prior to its sale. In addition, the accompanying receipt from\nthe sale of the tire shall state the manufacturer and the creation\ndate of the tire. Installation of a tire by anyone other than the\nowner of the motor vehicle shall include a sticker affixed to the\ntire and an accompanying receipt indicating the manufacturer and\ncreation date of the tire.\n\nProvisions of this new paragraph shall not apply to any motor vehicle\nwith tires installed as of the effective date of this paragraph.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nNone.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nTires have a limited shelf life despite how deep a tread may appear or\nthe usage amount. To the average eye, tires that have exceeded their\nshelf life may appear perfectly normal with no signs of deterioration.\nResearch shows that the poor condition of the tires is due to shelf\nlife, improper temperatures and unclean facilities. In 2008, the New\nYork State Department of Motor Vehicles released a report stating\nthat there were over 1,500 accidents due to tire failure with over a\nthird resulting in personal injury (tire failure occurs when a tire\nis underinflated, uneven or worn-out, amongst other conditions).\n\nMany car owners are unaware of the tire creation date due to placement\nof the date within the top sidewall portion of a hot tire mold. The\ndate, written as a manufacturing shift code, is cryptic and perplexing.\nFor example, the code \"8PY806\" means a tire was created on the 8th\nweek ('8') in the year 2006 ('06'), with 'SPY' symbolizing a\nmanufacturing shift code. It makes sense to display the manufacturer\nand the creation date on a label or sticker as it is instantaneous in\nproviding information to the consumer. A label or sticker on the tire\nthat clearly shows a \"born on date\", and a sales receipt indicating\nthe manufacturer and creation date of the\ntire will allow for consumers to know exactly how old the tire is,\n\nwhich results in consumer awareness and accident prevention. It is in\nthe best interest and responsibility of the state to move forward\nwith regulations regarding tire failure since federal regulation of a\nmanufacturing shift code is perplexing to the public.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010: S.7005 - Reported and Committed to Codes from Transportation.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNominal charges to tire manufacturers in compliance with this proposed\nnew paragraph.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall have\nbecome a law.\n\n",
