  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2464\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the social services law, in relation to the personal expense\nallowance for residents of residential health care facilities receiving\nor eligible to receive supplemental security income payments and/or\nadditional state payments\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo increase the personal needs allowance of certain residents of\nresidential health care facilities, to one hundred dollars per month.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nAmends Subdivision 2 of Section 366 of the Social Services Law, to\nincrease the personal expense allowance of residents of residential\ncare facilities, from fifty-five to one hundred dollars. Amends Item\n(A) of Clause (ii) to increase personal expenses of a resident of a\nresidential health care facility from fifty to one hundred dollars.\nAmends Item (A) of Clause (iii) to increase the maximum amount of\npersonal needs allowance for a veteran beneficiary from ninety to one\nhundred dollars.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe people at whom the increased allowance is aimed are senior\ncitizens who reside in skilled nursing facilities, some of whom\ndepend solely on Social Security and SSI or other forms of\nassistance. All of them are on fixed incomes that depend on this\nallowance to pay for everything from their clothing, toiletries and\nlaundry supplies to the few luxuries they can allow themselves, such\nas cable television, which currently costs more than half of their\nmonthly share.\n\nThe last increase in the personal needs allowance was in 1981. Since\nthat time, recipients have seen a drastic decrease in the real dollar\nvalue of their allowance. The personal needs allowance is an\nimportant quality of life issue for these residents.\n\nWhile 881 is a federal program, the personal needs allowance comes\nfrom State funds. None of the 881 cost of living adjustments of the\npast 19 years have applied to this allowance.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2003: S.232 - REFERRED TO SOCIAL SERVICES\n2004: S.232 - REFERRED TO SOCIAL SERVICES\n2005: S.2608 - REFERRED TO SOCIAL SERVICES\n2006: S.2608 - REFERRED TO SOCIAL SERVICES\n2007: S.3083 - REFERRED TO SOCIAL SERVICES\n2008: S.3083 - REFERRED TO SOCIAL SERVICES\n2009: S.4279 - REFERRED TO SOCIAL SERVICES\n2010: S.4279 - REFERRED TO SOCIAL SERVICES\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThe first of April after it has become law.\n\n",
