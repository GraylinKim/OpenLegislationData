  "fulltext" : "\nLEGISLATIVE  RESOLUTION commemorating the 34th Anniversary Sound & Light\nGala of the Helen Keller Services for the Blind to be held on  Thursday,\nSeptember 23, 2010\n\nWHEREAS,  It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize that the\nquality and character of life in the communities across New  York  State\nare reflective of the concerned and dedicated efforts of those organiza-\ntions  and individuals who would devote themselves to the welfare of the\ncommunity and its citizenry; and\n  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and in full accord with its  long-\nstanding  traditions,  this  Legislative Body is justly proud to commem-\norate the 34th Anniversary Sound  &  Light  Gala  of  the  Helen  Keller\nServices  for the Blind to be held at Stage 6 at Steiner Studios, Brook-\nlyn Navy Yard, on Thursday, September 23, 2010; and\n  WHEREAS, At this year's Gala, Helen Keller Services for the Blind will\npay special tribute to four exceptional women who have made a difference\nin the lives of many; they are: Jill Arkwright  Harvey,  Analytic  Asset\nManagement;  Abigail  Breslin,  Actress; Michelle Charlesworth, WABC-TV,\nChannel 7; and Kelly Watson, KPMG; and\n  WHEREAS, The history of this illustrious organization begins on Novem-\nber 2, 1883, when 17-year-old Eben Porter Morford was caught in a trage-\ndy that resulted in him becoming completely blind; undeterred,  he  went\non  to successfully train at The New York Institute for the Education of\nthe Blind; and\n  WHEREAS, Upon the completion of his studies, Eben Porter Morford real-\nized that there  were  almost  no  employment  opportunities  for  blind\npeople;  he  did  not understand as he reasoned that blindness was phys-\nical; vision was  mental  and  spiritual;  blindness  need  not  destroy\npatience, fortitude, ingenuity, courage and the will to win; and\n  WHEREAS,  Holding  true to these beliefs, in 1886, Eben Porter Morford\ngathered a small group of blind men and women together  at  the  Baptist\nHome on Throop and Greene Avenues in Brooklyn; the society was named the\nMizpah Circle and its purpose was for advancing socially and financially\nthose less fortunate than themselves; and\n  WHEREAS,  On October 1, 1893, the Industrial Home for Blind Men, under\nthe auspices of the Mizpah Circle, opened its doors; Eben Morford  acted\nas  superintendent  and by 1894, 17 blind men lived in the Home; 10 were\nemployed producing 416 cane seats, 28 hair mattresses and 4,500  brooms;\nand\n  WHEREAS,  Within two years, on April 25, 1895, the Industrial Home for\nthe Blind of the City of Brooklyn (IHB) was incorporated; for  50  years\nthe IHB confined itself to services to blind men; the Brooklyn Bureau of\nSocial  Services  and The Association for Improving the Condition of the\nPoor offered services to blind women; however, when these services  were\ndiminished, IHB opened its doors to women; and\n  WHEREAS,  The  IHB  programs continued to flourish and in the post war\nyears, a formal program for people who were deaf-blind was started;  the\nagency  shifted from the single focus of employment to a more comprehen-\nsive program of education and rehabilitation; and\n  WHEREAS, During the 1950s, services were  established  in  Nassau  and\nSuffolk  Counties;  Burrwod,  a  residence  for senior citizens who were\nblind and deaf-blind, was established  on  Long  Island;  the  IHB  also\nfounded a nursery school for blind children; and\n  WHEREAS, In 1952, IHB established a Braille and Large Print Library to\nmake  sure that textbooks were available for children who were blind and\nmainstreamed within their local schools; in 1953, a summer day camp  was\nopened to encourage participation in sports, music and drama; and\n\n  WHEREAS,  IHB  initiated  a major blindness prevention program in 1967\nfor pre-school children on Long Island; with the  assistance  of  volun-\nteers, IHB staff identified children who needed immediate medical inter-\nvention in order to prevent vision loss; and\n  WHEREAS,  In  1967, the Helen Keller National Center (HKNC) was estab-\nlished by a unanimous act of Congress and IHB was chosen to operate  the\nprogram  which provided comprehensive rehabilitation training for people\nwith a severe dual sensory loss or impairment; and\n  WHEREAS, Temporary training facilities were created in New Hyde  Park,\nand  in  1976,  HKNC's  new  headquarters opened a 25 acre site in Sands\nPoint, Long Island; the Center's national services expanded  to  include\nseveral regional offices, affiliate agencies and later a National Train-\ning  Team,  Technical  Assistance  Center,  National  Parent Network and\nServices for Older Adults; and\n  WHEREAS, In 1983, IHB established a day treatment program  for  adults\nwho were developmentally disabled and who were also blind or deaf-blind;\nin  1985, the Board of Trustees decided to change the name of The Indus-\ntrial Home for the Blind (IHB) to Helen Keller Services  for  the  Blind\n(HKSB); and\n  WHEREAS,  New  programs  continued  to  develop  and the Parent/Infant\nProgram was established in 1988; it provided intensive  therapeutic  and\neducational  services  for preschoolers and infants who were blind; that\nsame year, HKSB established Supported  Employment  services  to  provide\nongoing individualized long-term support at the job site; and\n  WHEREAS,  Over the years, program and facility changes have been made,\nas needed, to reflect the needs of a diverse population of  persons  who\nlive in the New York City Metropolitan Area; and\n  WHEREAS,  Throughout  its distinguished history, Helen Keller Services\nfor the Blind has  served  tens  of  thousands  of  blind  and  visually\nimpaired individuals throughout the New York Metropolitan Area; and\n  WHEREAS,  The ability of this agency to respond to changing needs over\nthe past 100 years has sustained its viability as an important resource;\nHKSB is well prepared and positioned to move  into  its  second  century\nmaintaining  a  commitment to the mission of enabling people of all ages\nwho are visually impaired, blind or deaf-blind to lead as independent  a\nlife as possible within their own communities; and\n  WHEREAS,  Organizations  and  individuals who are devoted to improving\nthe quality of life for others, enabling them to build lives of  dignity\nand self-worth are deserving of the highest praise and recognition; now,\ntherefore, be it\n  RESOLVED,  That  this  Legislative  Body pause in its deliberations to\ncommemorate the 34th Anniversary Sound & Light Gala of the Helen  Keller\nServices  for  the Blind to be held on Thursday, September 23, 2010, and\nto commend this year's four outstanding women for special honor who have\ntruly made a difference; and be it further\n  RESOLVED, That copies of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be tran-\nsmitted to Helen Keller Services for the Blind, and  the  aforementioned\nhonorees.\n",
