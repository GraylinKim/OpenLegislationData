  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2413\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the labor law, in relation to authorizing the commissioner of\nlabor to implement rules and regulations concerning the removal of lead,\nasbestos and other hazardous wastes\n\nPURPOSE:\nAuthorizes the commissioner of labor to implement rules and\nregulations regarding the removal of lead, asbestos, and other\nhazardous waste.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nAdds a new subdivision 6 to section 902 of the labor law.
