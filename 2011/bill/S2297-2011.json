The board may in passing on such\n   36  appeal make any reasonable exception and issue the certificate of  occu-\n   37  pancy subject to conditions that will protect any future street or high-\n   38  way  layout.  Any  such  decision  shall  be subject to review under the\n   39  provisions of article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules.\n   40  No permit shall be granted for the erection of any building or structure\n   41  in such city unless the owner  has  furnished  to  the  commissioner  of\n   42  transportation  of  such  city  a  policy of liability insurance, marked\n   43  paid, in such amounts as may be  fixed  by  such  department,  insuring,\n   44  indemnifying  and  saving  the  city  harmless  from  any claims, suits,\n   45  demands, causes of action and judgments by reason of  personal  injuries\n   46  sustained  by  any  person  or  persons,  including  death, and from any\n   47  claims, suits, demands, causes of action and judgments  for  damages  to\n   48  property,  occurring  on  any such street or highway giving access to or\n   49  abutting such structure, up to the date of the issuance of  the  certif-\n   50  icate  of  occupancy or up to the date of the completion of the improve-\n   51  ment of such street or highway  as  required  by  or  pursuant  to  this\n   52  section,  whichever  is later.

Every permit issued for the erection of any such\n   56  building or structure shall contain a statement that no  certificate  of\n\n       S. 2297                             3\n\n    1  occupancy  will  be  issued  with  respect to such building or structure\n    2  unless a street or highway giving access to such structure has been duly\n    3  placed on the official map or plan, which  street  or  highway  and  any\n    4  other mapped street or highway abutting such building or structure shall\n    5  have  been  suitably  improved  to the satisfaction of the department of\n    6  transportation of the city in accordance with standards  and  specifica-\n    7  tions  approved  by such department as adequate in respect to the public\n    8  health, safety and general welfare for the special circumstances of  the\n    9  particular  street  or  highway  or,  alternately,  unless the owner has\n   10  furnished to the department of transportation a performance bond  naming\n   11  the  city  as  obligee, approved by such department, sufficient to cover\n   12  the full cost of such improvement as estimated by  such  department,  or\n   13  other  security  approved by such department, that such improvement will\n   14  be completed within the time specified by such department.\n   15    S 2.
