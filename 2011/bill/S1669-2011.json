  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1669\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the social services law, in relation to individuals who refuse\nto participate in an investigation being conducted by child protective\nservices\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nTo create a system where a failure to participate (blatantly refusing\nto allow an investigator in the home or meet with investigators) in a\nchild protective investigation would indicate that a more thorough\ninvestigation is needed and would immediately issue a warrant:\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nAdds a new subsection (e) to section 422-a of the social service law.\nSubsection (i) states that if a child protective worker identifies\nthemselves and is carrying an ID card proving that they are, in fact,\na child protective worker, and the subject of the investigation (i.e.\nparent or guardian) blatantly refuses to meet with the worker or let\nthem into the home, the parent or guardian will have twenty-four\nhours to comply with the request for a meeting or a home visit.\n\nSubsection (ii) states that the child protective agency will be\nresponsible for informing the parent or guardian that the twentyÂ·four\nhours have lapsed. If the individual is still refusing to meet with\nchild protective workers than this should indicate a need for a more\nthorough investigation and an immediate warrant will be issued in\norder to evaluate the safety and well-being of the child or children.\nThis action will be taken upon the first blatant refusal of the parent\nor guardian.\nBlatant refusal is defined as verbally refusing a meeting or refusing\nto meet with investigators by using physical force.\n\nEFFECTS OF PRESENT LAW WHICH THIS BILL WOULD ALTER:\nThere is currently no action or lack of action that calls for an\nimmediate warrant for child protective workers to investigate a case\nunder current law. Presently, if the agency pursues a warrant or not\ndepends\nupon the judgment of each individual case worker's opinions on each\nindividual case.\n\nThis bill provides child protective workers with the power and\nauthority to pursue an immediate warrant if the subject of the\ninvestigation (i.e. parent or guardian) blatantly refuse to\nparticipate in the investigation by refusing to meet with workers or\nby refusing a home visit. This would occur upon the first refusal to\nparticipate and would provide an opportunity for child protective\nworkers to meet with the family in order to evaluate if the\nchild/children are in imminent danger.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nAfter the tragic death of Nixzmary Brown, age 7, who was brutally\ntortured and murdered by her stepfather, some sources have indicated\nthat her stepfather refused to comply with the child protective\nworker's request for a meeting with the family within their home.\nThere was talk of pursuing a warrant, but child protective services\nnever followed through. It has now become clear that some of the\nsubjective nature of child protective investigations must be removed.\n\nDefining specific circumstances that would issue an immediate warrant\nwould eliminate the subjectivity of when a warrant would be issued\nand for what behaviors or actions. One specific' circumstance that\nshould be an indication that an immediate warrant be issued is a\nparent or guardian's blatant refusal to meet with a investigator from\nchild protective services or allow such an investigator into their\nhome. Meeting with investigators, especially within the family's\nhome, provides critical information regarding the safety and\nwell-being of the child or children. These meetings are necessary in\nhelping to keep children out of harm's way.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.2156 of 2007\n02/01/07 Referred to Social Services, Children & Families\nS.131 of 2009\n01/07/09 REFERRED TO SOCIAL SERVICES, CHILDREN & FAMILIES\n01/16/09 REFERRED TO CHILDREN & FAMILIES\n01/06/10 REFERRED TO SOCIAL SERVICES, CHILDREN & FAMILIES\n01/20/10 COMMITTEE DISCHARGED AND COMMITTED TO CHILDREN & FAMILIES\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
