  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1476\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public health law, in relation to authorizing the state to\nacquire from the federal government the Franklin Delano Roosevelt campus\nof the department of veterans affairs Hudson Valley health care system\nat Montrose\n\nPURPOSE:\nAuthorizes the state to acquire from the federal government\nthe Montrose VA.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nSection one of the bill grants the\ncommissioner, with approval of the director of the budget and the\ndirector of the division of veterans affairs, authority to acquire\nportions of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt campus of the department of\nveterans affairs Hudson Valley health care system at Montrose if at\nany time they are no longer used for veteran's services, in order\nthat they may be used for veteran's purposes.\n\nSection two of this bill provides for an immediate effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe Franklin Delano Roosevelt Campus of the Department\nof Veteran's Affairs in Montrose, New York, is sacred ground. Many\nVeterans have resided at this facility and have known it as their\nonly home for many years.\n\nOriginally known as Crugers Point Park, the land was optioned to the\nVeterans' Administration by Westchester County Executive Herbert\nGerlach on February 13, 1945 for the construction of the first\nVeterans' facility in the nation. This land was deeded for Veteran's\nservices, and today is also home to the twenty-five acre New York\nState Veteran's Home at Montrose.\n\nOne of seventy-two lands acquired by the Veterans' Administration for\nthe purpose of constructing a V.A. Hospital-s, the Franklin Delano\nRoosevelt campus was unique to the Veterans' Administration\nconstruction program as the only departure from a main building\ndesign, and the campus was dedicated to memorialize President\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt upon its opening in 1949. Additionally, the\ncampus occupies the original site of the Boscobel House, already\nplaced on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn recent years, many of the critical services offered at this\nfacility, which sits across the Hudson River from the united states\nMilitary Academy West Point and caters to one of the State's largest\nVeterans populations, have been moved to other facilities and\nportions of the campus have fallen into disrepair.\n\nSitting on what is perhaps the last prime, undeveloped riverfront\nproperty along the Hudson River within thirty miles of New York City,\nin recent times, Montrose has attracted the gaze of developers who\nseek to make use of the Enhanced Use Lease provision of the United\nStates Code. One proposal left only 12 acres out of the 184 total\nacres for Veteran's services.\n\nWe cannot ask those who have given so much for us all, and their\nfamilies, to travel long distances for these services elsewhere in\norder to construct luxury condominiums. This land should remain\nsacred ground, forever used for Veteran's services, as was originally\nintended.\n\nAny development to the ground should be earmarked solely for veterans.\nThis legislation would authorize the Commissioner of Health to\nacquire those portions of the site no longer used for Veteran's\nservices to ensure the majority of the land will be kept, and\nincreased for Veteran's medical and other services, job training,\neducation, new skills development and more services for women Veterans.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010 - A.10604 - Held for Consideration in Public Health.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nVaries. The costs of the acquisition could range\nfrom fair market value when acquisition is authorized and made by\npurchase, to nothing, if the land were to be acquired by grant or\ncondemnation.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
