  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1993\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the executive law, in relation to requiring unanimous agreement\nby the parole board to release an inmate on parole\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo require unanimous consent to release an inmate on parole.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection one amends paragraph (a) of subdivision (2) of section 259-i\nof the executive law, to add a requirement that decisions of the\nboard to release an inmate be unanimous.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nExisting law requires a majority vote.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nWhen it comes to making the critical determination whether to set\nsomeone free on parole, the board should seek unanimity. Consider\nrecent decisions that resulted in the release of cop-killers.\nRecently, the Parole Board voted 2-1 to grant parole to cop killer\nShuaib Raheem. Raheem was involved in a botched armed robbery in\nWilliamsburg, NY in 1973, which resulted in the death of Patrolman\nStephen Gilroy and injured Patrolman Frank Carpentier. Also recently,\nafter pressure from some Senators and police organizations, cop\nkiller John MacKenzie, who opened fire during a burglary in West\nHempstead in 1975 and killed Nassau County Police Officer Matthew\nGiglio, was denied parole. Another convicted copkiller Anthony Blanks\nwas scheduled for a parole hearing at Shawangunk State Prison in\nWallkill, NY.\nBlanks is a cold-blooded cop-killer and a dangerous criminal. He\nkilled Patrolman Arthur Dematte in 1976 in Larchmont, using the\npoliceman's own revolver, and then fled in his police cruiser. His\nhearing has now been postponed. That homicide left Patrolman\nDematte's wife without a husband, his four young children without a\nfather, and his fellow officers without a friend and partner. Each\ntime Anthony Blanks is eligible for parole, the family is once again\nvictimized and the Police Department relives this tragedy.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.8259 of 2010 - Referred to Rules\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nImmediately.\n\n",
