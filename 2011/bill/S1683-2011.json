  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1683\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the environmental conservation law, in relation to allowing the\nuse of rifles for hunting in Cortland county\n\nPURPOSE:\nThe purpose of the legislation is to allow the hunting of\ndeer and bear with rifles in Cortland County.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThe bill amends section 11-0907 of the\nenvironmental conservation law to add C0111and County to the list of\ncounties in which the taking of deer by rifle is authorized.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nCurrent law allows the taking of deer in the southern\ntier, central, and western regions of the state by rifle in Allegany,\nCattaraugus, Chemung, Chenango, Herkimer, Madison, Montgomery,\nOneida, Oswego, Otsego, Schoharie, Schuyler, Steuben, Tioga, Yates,\nand a portion of Broome County.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe legislation, which has been introduced at the\nrequest of Cortland County, would allow sportsmen and women to hunt\ndeer and bear with rifles in the county. Big-game rifle hunting is\ncurrently permitted in many counties across New York State,\nincluding the neighboring counties of Chenango, Madison, and Tioga.\nThe experiences in these counties have been overwhelmingly positive,\nwith very few reported adverse incidents or problems. In fact,\nneighboring Madison County reported no incidents of accidents\ninvolving rifles reported during the first season (2008).\n\nThe decision to authorize the use of rifles for big-game hunting is\nbased upon the increasing deer population and declining hunting\npopulation ,which has in turn resulted in increased crop damage and\ncollision with automobiles.\nGiven the rural nature of Cortland County and the safety record of\nhunters in the counties where rifle use has been permitted, it would\nbe reasonable to now permit big-game hunters in Cortland County the\nsame opportunities.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.7487 of 2010\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately, with provisions.\n\n",
