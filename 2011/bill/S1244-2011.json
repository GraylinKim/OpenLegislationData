  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1244\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the labor law, in relation to prohibiting state funding to\nbusinesses that outsource jobs\n\nPURPOSE:\nAllow State funding when applicable to those companies that create\njobs within New York state, and prohibit financial incentives for\ncompanies that send jobs outside the State.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 219 of the Labor Law, which details violations of certain wage\npayment provisions, is amended.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nNone, although efforts have been made in the New York State\nLegislature to address this topic.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nAs jobs are consolidated and cut, and as companies recoup profits\nthrough different measures, workers will feel the effects through\ndiminished wages, decreased work hours and loss of their position to\nlower paid workers. outsourcing is an attractable option for\ncompanies looking to cut their costs and it is our intention to\ncreate barriers for companies that utilize this option. A company\nshould not be rewarded with state funding when they utilize the\nmonies for workers outside the State.\n\nThe local economy often feels the affect of outsourcing for fewer jobs\nare available to local residents. In turn, quality-of-life i.s\ndiminished as residents are left without viable forms of employment\nin their local town, village or county and are thus pressured to seek\nemployment elsewhere, sometimes outside New York State. In addition,\nmore people will seek food stamps and other means of public support\nto get themselves and families by. As outsourcing continues and\nresidents leave the state, tax monies that can be utilized to create\nnew jobs are lost due to a decline in the number of residents.\n\nThe premise of this proposed legislation is simple: keeps jobs and\nresidents in New York state.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010: S.7594 - Referred to Labor\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone expected.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis act shall take effect on the first of April next succeeding the\ndate it shall become a law.\n\n",
