Subparagraph (E) of paragraph  1  of  subsection  (e)  of\n    2  section  606  of  the  tax law, as amended by chapter 105 of the laws of\n    3  2006, is amended to read as follows:\n    4    (E) \"Qualifying real property taxes\" means all  real  property  taxes,\n    5  special  ad  valorem levies and special assessments, exclusive of penal-\n    6  ties and interest, levied on the residence of a qualified  taxpayer  and\n    7  paid  during  the taxable year [less the credit claimed under subsection\n    8  (n-1) of this section]. In addition, for taxable years  beginning  after\n    9  December thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-four, a qualified taxpay-\n   10  er  may  elect  to  include  any  additional amount that would have been\n   11  levied in the absence of an exemption from real property taxation pursu-\n   12  ant to section four hundred sixty-seven of the real property tax law. If\n   13  tenant-stockholders in a cooperative housing corporation  have  met  the\n   14  requirements of section two hundred sixteen of the internal revenue code\n   15  by  which they are allowed a deduction for real estate taxes, the amount\n   16  of taxes so allowable, or which would be allowable if the  taxpayer  had\n   17  filed  returns on a cash basis, shall be qualifying real property taxes.\n   18  If a residence is owned by two or more individuals as joint  tenants  or\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD00142-01-1\n\n       A. 877                              2\n\n    1  tenants  in  common, and one or more than one individual is not a member\n    2  of the household, qualifying real property taxes is that  part  of  such\n    3  taxes  on  the  residence which reflects the ownership percentage of the\n    4  qualified  taxpayer  and  members of his household. If a residence is an\n    5  integral part of a larger unit, qualifying real property taxes shall  be\n    6  limited  to  that  amount of such taxes paid as may be reasonably appor-\n    7  tioned to such residence. If a household owns and occupies two  or  more\n    8  residences during different periods in the same taxable year, qualifying\n    9  real  property  taxes  shall  be the sum of the prorated qualifying real\n   10  property taxes attributable to the household  during  the  periods  such\n   11  household  occupies  each  of such residences. If the household owns and\n   12  occupies a residence for part of the taxable year and rents a  residence\n   13  for  part of the same taxable year, it may include both the proration of\n   14  qualifying real property taxes on the residence owned and the real prop-\n   15  erty tax equivalent with respect to the months the residence is  rented.\n   16  Provided,  however,  for  purposes  of  the  credit  allowed  under this\n   17  subsection, qualifying real property taxes may be included by  a  quali-\n   18  fied  taxpayer  only  to  the extent that such taxpayer or the spouse of\n   19  such taxpayer occupying such residence for six months  or  more  of  the\n   20  taxable year owns or has owned the residence and paid such taxes.\n   21    S  2.
