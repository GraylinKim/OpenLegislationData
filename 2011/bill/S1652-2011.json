  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1652\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the alcoholic beverage control law, in relation to permits for\nlicensed brewers\n\nPURPOSE OF THE BILL:\nThis bill amend &sect; 51 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law by adding a\nnew subdivision 9 to allow a licensed brewer to obtain a Beer\nFestival permit from the State Liquor Authority and allow\nparticipating brewers and their brewery personnel to dispense and\nserve their products to persons of legal age.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThis bill allows a licensed brewer to obtain a permit to hold a Beer\nFestival and to invite brewers to offer small samples of their malt\nbeverage products. Samples per brand shall not exceed 3 ounces per\nserving. The permit holder shall receive for distribution all\nproducts that shall be properly invoiced and inventoried and return\nany unused product to the distributor for credit. Each participating\nbrewer or the brewer's representative shall be allowed to dispense\nand serve their products.\nThe brewers participating may sell sealed containers for off-premises\nconsumption. Food products may be available for sale and proper\nsecurity must be provided at each Beer Festival to determine lawful\nproof of age and to remove any patron that appears intoxicated or is\nout of order.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe state presently licenses seventy-three craft brewing facilities\nthis bill provides small brewers an inexpensive opportunity to\nadvertise, dispense and serve their products and to interact directly\nwith target patrons who may not be able to sample craft beers as they\nare not readily available in most licensed food stores, bars or\nrestaurants.\nThe craft brewing industry is a growing industry in New York and has\nvitalized the economy and added to the workforce in many urban areas\nof our state. The New York State Law Revision Commission recommended\nin their final report that \"the law should be amended to clarify that\nbrewers participating in beer festivals can supervise the tasting of\ntheir beer and take back left over products and that licensed brewers\nor their employees should be allowed to dispense and serve the\nbrewer's product at beer festivals.\"\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010 - S.8183/A.11393\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nThis bill generates a modest new sum annually. The permit fee is $20\nper function.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
