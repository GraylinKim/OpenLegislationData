  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1767\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public service law, in relation to providing for unlisted\ntelephone numbers without charge for certain victims of domestic\nviolence\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill would allow for unlisted telephone numbers without charge\nfor victims of domestic violence for whose benefit an order of\nprotection has been issued.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSubdivision 7 of the bill would amend Section 91 of the public Service\nLaw to provide victims of domestic violence for whose benefit an\norder of protection has been issued, other than a temporary order of\nprotection, for the duration of such order, an unlisted telephone\nnumber from any directory of telephone numbers published by it or any\nand a affiliated companies, free of charge.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThis bill corrects an existing discrepancy regarding orders of\nprotection and victims of domestic violence. Our State has a duty,\nunder the \"Parent patre mantra\", to protect those citizens seeking\nrefuge and protection against their aggressors. Allowing aggressors\nto obtain unlisted/non private telephone numbers of their victims to\nharass, intimidate and sometimes coerce the victim circumvent the\npurpose of an order of protection. Recent reports that 44% of the\nwomen killed between 2003 and 2005 died at the hands of their\nboyfriends or spouses. That means that nearly half of all the women\nmurdered in the city are killed by their intimate partners.\n\nThis proposed Amendment would provide the help that victims still need.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-2010: Referred to Energy and Telecommunications\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nOne hundred twenty days.\n\n",
