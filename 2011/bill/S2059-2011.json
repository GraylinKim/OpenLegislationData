  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2059\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the public health law, in relation to prohibiting the denial of\nemployment of an MRI technologist solely based on their lack of\nlicensure and/or certification in x-ray or radiography\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nThis bill would define \"magnetic resonance imaging technologist\" and\nmakes it unlawful to deny employment to any magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) technologist certified by a nationally recognized\norganization, as a magnetic imaging technologist, solely on the basis\nthat he or she lacks licensure and/or certification in x-ray or\nradiography.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nSection 1 of this bill provides a definition for \"magnetic resonance\nimaging technologist\".\n\nSection 2 of this bill makes it unlawful to deny employment to any\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technologist certified by a\nnationally recognized organization, as a magnetic imaging\ntechnologist, solely on the basis that he or she lacks licensure\nand/or certification in x-ray or radiography.\n\nSection 3 of this bill provides for an immediate effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a technology used by physicians\nand hospitals that uses magnetic signals, rather than X-rays to\ncreate images of the human body. Unlike x-rays, MRI technologists do\nnot use ionizing radiation, however, this distinction is often not\nclear to employers when seeking to hire magnetic resonance imaging\ntechnologists, often resulting in those certified by nationally\nrecognized organizations in the field to be denied employment because\nthey lack licensure and/or certification in x-ray or radiology. This\nin effect, has created a shortage of MRI technologists in many areas,\nand a lack of competition in the marketplace providing these services.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
