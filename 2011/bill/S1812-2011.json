  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1812\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the general municipal law, the retirement and social security\nlaw and the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to\nnot including overtime compensation in pension computation earned after\nMarch thirty-first, two thousand ten\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThis bill provides that overtime payments made\nafter March 31, 2012 will not be included in the computation of\npension benefits.\n\nSECTION 1 amends section 90 of the General Municipal Law to provide\nthat amounts received as overtime compensation received after April\n1, 2010 shall not be regarded as salary or compensation for any of\nthe purposes of any pension or retirement system.\n\nSection 2 amends subdivision 2 of section 2 of the Retirement and\nSocial Security Law to provide that salary or wages shall not include\namounts received as overtime compensation received after April 1, 2012.\n\nSection 3 amends paragraph a of subdivision 2 of section 302 of the\nRetirement and Social Security Law to provide that salary and wages\nshall not include amounts received as overtime compensation on or\nafter April 1, 2012.\n\nSection 4 amends section 12-108 of the Administrative Code of the City\nof New York to provide that amounts received as overtime compensation\nprior to April 1, 2012 pursuant to the provisions of the section\nshall be regarded as salary or compensation for the purposes of any\npension or retirement system of which the employee receiving such\nemployee receiving such overtime compensation system is a member.\n\nSECTION 5 provides that this act shall take effect immediately.\n\nPURPOSE AND JUSTIFICATION:\nRecently, it has become apparent that some employees have abused the\nsystem of seeking overtime to significantly increase their salaries\nin their final years of employment so as to\nartificially inflate their eventual pension benefits. Retirement\nsystems, public employers and taxpayers cannot afford to fund\nartificially inflated pensions created by abuse of the overtime\nsystem. Examples abound of employees who boost their pay through\nhundreds of hours of overtime as they prepare to retire, ending up\nwith pension benefits that are higher than their base pay while they\nwere employed. In addition to the costs to taxpayers, it is not\npossible for an employee to be effective for the number of hours some\nemployees are claiming per week. The current system encourages\nworking excessive hours which are unhealthful for the employee and\nresult in ineffective service to the public.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nCurrently, overtime pay in included in the calculation\nof pension benefits.\n\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010: S.5247 - Local Government\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nShould reduce costs for state and local governments.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
