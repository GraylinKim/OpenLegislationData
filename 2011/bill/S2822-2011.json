The  viability\n    7  of small businesses and the overall economic and environmental status of\n    8  New  York  state  will  be  enhanced  by  the development, expansion and\n    9  promotion of accessible and affordable programs to  assist  small  busi-\n   10  nesses  in  energy conservation, energy efficiency, and increased use of\n   11  renewable resources, and by ensuring equitable treatment of small  busi-\n   12  nesses in the proceedings of energy-related regulatory agencies.\n   13    The  legislature hereby establishes a small business energy assistance\n   14  and advocacy services program as part of the division for small business\n   15  within the New York state department of economic development  to  assist\n   16  small businesses in accessing energy conservation, energy efficiency and\n   17  renewable  energy programs available through public and private sources,\n   18  and to advocate for the initiation and expansion of  such  programs  and\n   19  for  equitable  treatment  of small businesses in regulatory proceedings\n   20  related to energy.\n   21    S 2.
