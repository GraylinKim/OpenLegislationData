  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2169\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to enhanced sentencing for criminal\npossession of a weapon or criminal sale of a firearm, when the crime is\ncommitted at the home of a child\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nThe purpose of this bill is to target criminals who possess and sell\nfirearms in residences that also serve as the home of children under\nthe age of fourteen.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nSection 1. Adds a new section, 265.18, to the Penal Law that provides\nfor an additional sentence when weapons are illegally possessed or\nfirearms are illegally sold in a home that is also the dwelling of\na child under the age of fourteen or in the presence of such child.\n\nThe bill provides that when a person is convicted of criminal\npossession of a weapon in the first degree (Penal Law &sect;265.04),\nsecond degree (Penal Law &sect;265.03) or third degree (&sect;265.02), and such\ncrime was committed at a place which is the dwelling or residence of\na child under age 14, a consecutive sentence of two and a half years\nis added on to the minimum sentence. If this crime is committed in\nthe presence of a child under age 14, the enhanced consecutive\nsentence is five years. Any person convicted under these provisions\nwill not be eligible for parole until the n:linimum sentence and the\nenhanced sentence is served.\n\nCriminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree (&sect;265.01) is\nintentionally excluded because it is a misdemeanor and the purpose of\nthe bill is to target felons.\n\nThe enhanced sentencing provisions also apply to the criminal sale of\na firearm in the first through third degree (Penal Law &sect;265.14,\n&sect;265.13, &sect;265.12 and &sect;265.11) and criminal sale of a firearm to a\nminor (Penal Law &sect;265.16). All of the firearms sales crimes are also\nfelonies.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nThe purpose of this bill is to target criminals who possess and sell\nfirearms in residences that also serve as the home of children under\nthe age of fourteen. In many instances, these individuals are also\ndealing or using drugs in a dwelling that is located in a large\napartment building or housing complex. Often, young children either\nlive in or around these dwellings. The activities of these criminals\n\nputs not only the children, but all of the law abiding citizens in\nthese communities at grave risk of injury or death.\n\nThis Legislation provides a solution that can be immediately\nimplemented. The enhanced sentencing provided in this bill is\ndesigned to make the lives of drug dealers and other kinds of\ngangsters miserable to the point where it is no longer in their best\ninterest to dwell in and terrorize these communities.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\nS.8418 of 2010, Referred to Rules\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThe first of November next succeeding the date it becomes law.\n\n",
