  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2294\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act to amend the criminal procedure law, in relation to establishing\ngun court calendars in the criminal courts\n\nPURPOSE/SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThe bill would amend the New York State Criminal Procedure Law to create\na gun court calendar designed to exclusively hear gun related cases. The\npresiding justice of the criminal court in the state shall create a gun\ncourt calendar for the effected counties and shall assign personnel to\nprocess all criminal cases tried by the court.  All trials assigned to\nthe court will be scheduled within sixty days of the completion of\ndiscovery. No continuances or postponements shall be granted except for\ngood cause shown. Necessary continuances will be granted for the short-\nest practicable time. The goals of the court are to reduce the number of\ngun cases and ensure that perpetrators serve prison time.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nFindings indicate that there has been significant growth in the use of\nfirearms in the commission of violent crimes. According to New York City\npolice officials, guns were used in 34.2% of the 143,654 felonies\ncommitted in the City in 1993.\n\nThis constitutes:\n\n*47,991 felonies committed involving handguns\n\n*784 felonies committed involving shotguns\n\n*145 felonies committed involving rifles\n\n*254 felonies committed involving machine guns\n\nFigures for the State are equally bleak. According to the New York State\nDivision of Criminal Justice Services, reported homicides committed with\nguns in 1993 totaled 1,739. Also, it is estimated that in 1994 over\n9,600 individuals were arrested whose most serious charge at arrest\ninvolved firearm and armed felony offenses. Many of the shootings are\ndrug or gang related and endanger law abiding citizens. Additionally,\nmany of the gun offenses are committed while individuals are free on\nbail for other offenses. The growing number of gun related offenses\nconstitutes a burden upon the State of New York and threatens the domes-\ntic tranquility of the State and its people. Especially affected are\nresidents of the urban areas where these crimes are most prevalent.  The\nLegislature recognizes that in order to deter the use of firearms in the\ncommission of violent crime, and to protect the law abiding public,\nthere must be swift disposition of gun related offenses. By placing\nrepeat offenders prone to weapon use in jail within months of their\ncrime for a longer duration of time, crime will fall dramatically. Simi-\n\nlar legislation has been successfully implemented in Rhode Island and\nhas been supported by both the NRA and gun control groups.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect thirty days after the date upon which it\nshall have become a law.\n\n",
