  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2331\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the social services law, in\nrelation to the confidentiality of calls to certain\nhotlines operated by the office of children and\nfamily services\nand in relation to cross references to penal law\nprovisions on filing a false report in the third degree\n\nPURPOSE OF THE BILL:\nThis bill would enhance statutory provisions that\nprotect the identity of callers to the Statewide central Register of\nChild Abuse and Maltreatment (SCR) and other hotlines operated by the\nOffice of Children and Family Services (OCFS) and strengthen the\nprotection of confidential information maintained by OCFS.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 of the bill would amend the Social\nServices Law to protect from disclosure the identity of a caller to\nthe Abandoned Infant Protection Act (AIPA) toll-free hotline. AIPA\nhotline records would be confidential and disclosable only by court\norder. However, the amendment would make clear that OCFS is not\nrequired to maintain any record pertaining to a call to the AIPA\nhotline.\n\nSection 2 of the bill would amend the Social Services Law to protect\nfrom disclosure the identity of a person making a complaint to the\nOCFS toll free telephone line for inquiries and complaints about child\nday care programs.\nAny records that could identify a complainant would be confidential\nand would not be disclosed without that person's written permission,\nexcept where a law enforcement agency states that the information is\nnecessary for a criminal investigation or prosecution, or where\ndisclosure is ordered by a court upon a finding that the information\nis necessary to determine an issue before the court.\n\nSection 3 of the bill would amend the Social Services Law to protect\nfrom disclosure any record pertaining to a telephone call to the SCR\nthat does not constitute a report of suspected child abuse or\nmaltreatment because the person responsible cannot legally be the\nsubject of a report. The amendment would clarify that these records\nare confidential and are not disclosable except to a law enforcement\nagency where the circumstances described in the call may constitute a\ncrime or an immediate threat to the health or safety a child.\n\nSection 4 of the bill would amend the Social Services Law to protect\nfrom disclosure any record pertaining to a telephone call to the SCR\nthat does not constitute a report of suspected child abuse or\nmaltreatment for a reason other than specified in paragraph (c). The\n\namendment would clarify that these records are confidential and are\nnot disclosable except to a law enforcement agency where the agency\nstates that the information is necessary for a criminal investigation\nor prosecution, or where disclosure is ordered by a court upon a\nfinding that the information is necessary to determine an issue\nbefore the court. New paragraph (d) also would make clear that the SCR\nis not required to maintain any record pertaining to a call that is\nnot accepted as a report.\n\nSection 5 of the bill would Social Services Law to make certain\ntechnical clarifications and protect from disclosure telephone\nrecords identifying the numbers from which calls are made to the SCR.\nThe amendments would make it clear that a caller's telephone number\nand other contact information are confidential.\n\nSection 6 of the bill would amend the Social Services Law to provide\nthat any person who willfully discloses, permits the disclosure of,\nor encourages the release of any data and information contained in\nthe SCR in violation of law is a class A misdemeanor.\n\nSection 7 of the bill provides for an immediate effective date, except\nthat section 6 of the bill would take effect on the first November\nfirst after the bill becomes law.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\n\nSSL &sect; 372-g establishes the AIPA and requires that OCFS implement a\npublic information program to inform the public about the provisions\nof the AIPA, through the availability of educational materials in\nvarious media, public service announcements, and a toll-free hotline.\n\nSSL &sect; 390(3) authorizes OCFS to make announced and unannounced\ninspections of licensed and registered child day care providers and\nto investigate reports of persons who may be providing child day care\nwithout the appropriate license or registration. The monitoring\nauthority in SSL &sect; 390(3) includes a requirement that OCFS establish\na toll-free statewide telephone number to receive inquiries about\nchild day care and complaints regarding statutory and regulatory\nviolations.\n\nSSL &sect; 422(4) makes SCR records confidential and governs their\ndisclosure. SSL &sect; 422(12) provides that a person who willfully\npermits and a person who encourages the release of confidential SCR\ndata to an unauthorized person is guilty of a class A misdemeanor.\n\nSSL &sect; 422(12) provides that it is a Class A misdemeanor to permit or\nencourage the release of any data or information in the SCR.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nFirst introduced in 2011.\n\nSTATEMENT IN SUPPORT:\n\nOCFS is concerned about maintaining the\nconfidentiality of sensitive information received through the SCR and\nother hotlines operated by OCFS. This bill would strengthen existing\nconfidentiality provisions governing the SCR to better protect the\nidentity of callers and the confidentiality of SCR records. The bill\nwould also address the need to protect the identity of callers to the\nAIPA hotline and complainants who call the OCFS child day care\ntoll-free telephone line.\n\nThe Social Services law sets forth the responsibilities of the SCR to\nreceive reports of suspected child abuse and maltreatment, refer\naccepted reports for investigation and provide due process for\nsubjects who wish to challenge an \"indicated\" report. SSL &sect; 422(4)\nmakes SCR records and the identity of a person who reports suspected\nchild abuse or maltreatment to the SCR confidential. This bill would\namend SSL &sect; 422 to clarify that telephone records that identify the\nnumbers from which calls to the SCR were made are also confidential.\nIn addition, information concerning a call to the SCR, even if the\ncall is not accepted as a report, and any records generated by such\ncall, are also confidential. This bill would also amend SSL &sect; 422(12)\nto provide that a person who willfully and wrongfully accesses or\ndiscloses confidential information from the SCR is guilty of a class\nA misdemeanor. The current statute only provides for the crime of\nwrongfully releasing confidential SCR information, not the crime of\nwrongfully accessing such information. This bill also safeguards the\nconfidentiality of the identity of callers to the AIPA hotline and to\nthe OCFS child day care toll-free telephone line.\n\nThe purpose of the AIPA is to encourage a person who is considering\nabandoning his or her newborn baby to instead leave the baby with an\nappropriate person, or in a suitable location and promptly notify an\nappropriate person. Where a baby is safely abandoned, the Penal Law\nprovides an affirmative defense to prosecution for abandonment.\nGuaranteeing the confidentiality of the identity of callers would\nencourage persons to call the AIPA hotline without fear of\nretribution or adverse consequences. Although OCFS does not maintain\nany records pertaining to calls to the AIPA hotline, this bill\nclarifies that a court order would be necessary to compel any\ndisclosure. Similarly, this bill makes clear that the identity of\ncomplainants calling the OCFS toll-free number to report child day\ncare violations is confidential. This should encourage reporting and\nbetter protect the safety of persons calling the day care complaint\nline. Reports to the toll-free telephone line are an important means\nfor OCFS to find out that someone is operating an illegal unlicensed\nor unregistered child day care program. Parents and other individuals\nalso call the hotline to express their concerns about possible\nregulatory or statutory violations in licensed or registered\nchild day care programs. Sometimes, the caller does not want\nthe child day care provider to know who made the complaint. The bill\nmakes these toll-free telephone line records confidential and limits\ndisclosure to where the complainant consents in writing, disclosure\n\nis required by court order, or where law enforcement states that the\ninformation is necessary for a criminal investigation or prosecution.\n\nBUDGET IMPLICATIONS:\nThis bill has no fiscal implications.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis bill would take effect immediately, except\nsection 6, which would take effect on the first November first after\nit becomes law.\n\n",
