  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2540\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the estates, powers and trusts law, in relation to payment\nand distribution of damages in wrongful death actions\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill would permit the families of wrongful death victims\nto recover compensation for their emotional anguish.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThe bill amends EPTL section 5-4.3, the\nwrongful death statute, to permit recovery of damages for emotional\nloss when a tortfeasor is found liable for causing a death. Current\nlaw allows recovery of pecuniary loss only, thus making it impossible\nfor spouses, children, parents, and siblings to receive any\ncompensation for their non-economic loss.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nFamilies who suffer the loss of a loved one must endure\na second blow, when they discover the civil justice system is unable\nto compensate them for their emotional loss. A wrongful death statute\nthat is nearly 150 years old, and sadly out of step with our sister\nstates, prohibits the grief-stricken family from recovering damages\nfor their emotional suffering from the wrong doer.\n\nThe current law, which awards compensation for pecuniary loss only,\nimpacts most harshly on children, seniors, women and minorities, who\noften have no income or significantly less income, and are\ntraditionally undervalued in our society. For many years, the courts\nhave struggled to overcome the current law's narrow and inhumane\nlanguage, which measures the worth of loved family members solely by\ntheir value as wage earners. The law, in essence, says that the\nattributes of our family members that we most value--emotional\nsupport, love, companionship, advice and guidance--count for nothing.\n\nAt least 41 other states compensate family members for emotional loss.\nThis bill will not only better address and more fully right the wrong\nto the family of the deceased, it will-also deter the negligent,\nreckless, sometimes criminal behavior that leads to needless deaths.\nIt is ironic and contrary to public policy that currently a wrongdoer\nmay take advantage of the law that makes it cheaper to kill someone\nthan to seriously injure them. This bill would correct this harsh\nanomaly of the current wrongful death law.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.2391/A.2872 (2009-10); S.1266/A.6420\n(2007-08); S.54/A.5856 (2005-06); S.2994/A.6637 (2003-04);\nS.793/A.7789 (2001-02) S.5487/A.8013 (1999);\nS.585-A/A.4553-A (1997); S.2133/A.3224 (1995); S.8558/A.11792 (1994)\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately and shall apply to all trials commenced on or\nafter said date.\n\n",
