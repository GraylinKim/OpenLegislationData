  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2113\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the private housing finance law, in relation to annual\nreports of limited profit and limited-dividend housing companies\n\nSUMMARY:\nThis bill would amend Private Housing\nFinance Law &sect; 32(2) to\nrequire each Mitchell-Lama housing company to annually provide the\nCommissioner of Housing or the appropriate supervising agency its tax\nexemption levels and the date any tax abatement or exemption is\nscheduled to expire. It would also amend Section 32-b of the Private\nHousing and Community Renewal to include information on tax\nabatements and tax exemptions granted by localities to Mitchell-Lama\nprojects in DHCR's Annual Report to the Legislature on the\nMitchell-Lama Program. This bill would also mandate that DHCR's\nreport specify the date which any tax abatement or exemption is\nscheduled to expire.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nArticle 2 of the Private Housing\nFinance Law allows\nlocalities to provide tax relief to Mitchell-Lama projects within\ntheir jurisdiction. Private Housing Finance Law Section 33 limits\nsuch relief to a maximum of thirty years. Given this lack of\npermanence of the tax relief, many residents and project managers are\nunaware that tax reductions granted by localities many years ago may\nbe about to end. The Division of Housing and Community Renewal is\ncurrently required to submit a comprehensive report on the\nimplementation of the Mitchell-Lama Program to the Legislature prior\nto July 1st of each year. This report is required to include\ninformation on rent and carrying charge levels, total capital outlay,\namortization, mortgage interest rates, surcharge billings use of\nsurcharge revenues and vacancy rates. By requiring this report to\nalso include the projected expiration date of any tax exemption on\nabatement, this bill would put residents of Mitchell-Lama projects\nand project managers on notice and permit them to adequately prepare\nfor the impending rise in tax liability. Moreover, current law\nrequires municipalities and supervising agencies to furnish data\nrequested by the Commissioner for inclusion in this report within\n60 days of this request. Accordingly, the inclusion of tax relief\nexpiration dates should not.place any administrative burden on the\nDivision.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATION:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis act shall take effect on the\nthirtieth day after\nit shall have become a law.\n\n",
