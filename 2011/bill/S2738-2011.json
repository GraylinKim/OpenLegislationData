  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2738\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the family court act, in relation to evidence of child\nneglect where the respondent is voluntarily and regularly\nparticipating in a recognized drug rehabilitation program and\nrequiring enrollment in rehabilitative\nprograms\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo make enrollment in a drug program a factor at the dispositional\nphase of a child neglect proceeding rather than an affirmative\ndefense to a finding of neglect.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection one amends subparagraph (B) of paragraph (i) of subdivision\n(f) of section 1012 of the Family Court Act to delete the language\nrelated to participation in a rehabilitation program, together with\nthe presumption related to participation in such program.\n\nSection two amends paragraph (iii) of subdivision (a) of section 1046\nof the Family Court Act to delete the language related to the\nexception provided by participation in a rehabilitation program.\n\nSection three adds a new subdivision (d) to section 1052 of the Family\nCourt Act to provide that, following an adjudication of neglect where\nthe respondent has been found to be misusing drugs or alcoholic\nbeverages to the extent that self-control of his or her actions is\nlost, the court shall at the time of the final order of disposition,\ntake into consideration the enrollment and satisfactory participation\nof the respondent in a recognized rehabilitation program, and the\ncourt may in connection with such order of disposition require the\nrespondent to enroll and participate in such a pro gram.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nProvides that enrollment in a drug rehabilitation program is an\naffirmative defense to a finding of child neglect on drug abuse\ngrounds.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nUnder current legislation, the respondent's voluntary and regular\nparticipation in a recognized rehabilitation program would exclude a\npresumption of neglect of the child in care, even where there has\nbeen evidence of repeated misuse of drugs or alcoholic beverages.\nVoluntary attendance in such a program is no assurance that drug or\nalcohol abuse has ceased as the respondent may still get obtain\ncontrolled substances on the streets. Also, the respondent may have\nreturned to the misuse of drug and alcohol after completion of a\nrehabilitation program.\n\nThis exclusion of the normal presumption is confusing to child\nprotective workers, lawyers and the courts and acts against the\ninterests of children. It is unclear how the exception affects the\nburden of proof and whether participation in a rehabilitation program\nis a defense to an allegation of child neglect. This confusion has\nbeen exacerbated as the number of neglect and abuse allegations\ninvolving drug use by a parent has increased enormously in recent\nyears.\n\nThis legislation would clarify the law by retaining the presumption\nthat misuse of drugs or alcohol constitutes a prima facie case of\nabuse or neglect. The participation of the parent in a rehabilitation\nprogram would be considered by the judge at disposition, along with\nother factors.\nThe participation in the program would not, and should not, constitute\na rebuttal of the presumption. It would be subject to the\ndetermination, based on the preponderance of the evidence, of what is\nin the best interest of the child. Further, the court may order the\nrespondent, as part of the disposition, to enroll in a rehabilitation\nprogram to receive needed treatment.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2007-2008: S.1075 - Referred to Social Services, Children and Families\n2005-2006: S.467  - Referred to Social Services, Children and Families\n2003-2004: S.1917 - Passed Senate\n2001-2002: S.395  - Passed Senate\n2000:      S.2722 - Passed Senate\n1997-98:   S.489  - Passed Senate\n1995-96:   S.2104 - Passed Senate\n1993-94:   S.3379 - Passed Senate\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nOne hundred twenty days after it shall have become law.\n\n",
