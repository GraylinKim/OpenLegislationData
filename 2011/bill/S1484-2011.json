  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1484\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nin relation to directing the president of the state civil service\ncommission to publish reports relating to diversity within the state\ngovernment\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection One. The president of the state civil service commission\nwithin the department of civil service is hereby directed to study\nand publish annual reports recording data relating to diversity\nwithin the state and civil divisions thereof as well as appointments\nto all state agencies, authorities, boards, bureaus, commissions,\ndepartments and divisions.\nThe president of the state civil service commission shall annually\npublish such reports and findings. Such reports shall be sent to the\nchair of the senate standing committee on investigations and\ngovernment operations and to the chair of the assembly standing\ncommittee on governmental employees no later than the first of\nFebruary in each year.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIn previous years the State Civil Service commission published data\nrelating to diversity within the State Civil service system. For\nreasons left unexplained, the Commission has stopped publishing such\nreports, thereby leaving the State Legislature uninformed regarding\nthe statistical makeup of the Civil service sector.\n\nThis legislation also requires publication of this data in addition to\ndata previously unrecorded. This bill also requires for the\nacquisition and publication of data from all sectors of the State\nGovernment, including appointments. It simply seeks solid data which\ncan be used to measure minority and women hirings by the New York\nState Government.\n\nA recent study by the Center for Women in Government, entitled\n'Democracy unrealized', has shown that Policy Level appointees within\nthe State of New York are grossly devoid of both minorities and\nwomen. out of sixty-three (63) policy level appointees, only eighteen\n(18) are women and of that eighteen only three (3) are persons of\nAfrican-American or Latino background. Of the remaining forty-five\n(45) male appointees, only four (4) are men of African-American or\nLatino backgrounds.\nConspicuously absent from these appointments are persons of Asian or\nNative American backgrounds. This leaves New York State, one of the\nmost diverse states in the Nation, with one of the lowest races of\ndiversity for Policy-Level appointees.\n\nThis legislation seeks not to remedy this gross lack of diversity, but\nto obtain data that can be used to study and mediate this problem in\nthe future.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-10: S.2163/A.1473 - REFERRED TO CIVIL SERVICE AND\nPENSIONS/Referred to Governmental Employees.\n2007:    S.2475\n2006:    S.6969\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
