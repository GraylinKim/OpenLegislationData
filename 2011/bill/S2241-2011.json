  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2241\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the civil rights law, in relation to the right of free\nspeech in shopping malls\n\nSUMMARY:\nThis bill would add new subdivision sixteen\nto the Civil\nRights Law to prohibit owners of shopping malls from unreasonably\ndenying a person the right to speak freely and distribute written\nmaterial.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe Court of Appeals has held that New York State's\nConstitution does not give individuals the right to express their\nviews on private property. SHAD ALLIANCE V. SMITH\nHAVEN MALL,\n66N.Y.2d 496 (1985).\nPrivately owned shopping centers have, in many communities, replaced\ndowntown business districts as public gathering places. The number of\nsuch malls has dramatically increased over the past 25 years. The\nexercise of free speech by those who seek to communicate with the\ngeneral public is adversely affected by a complete denial of access\nto privately owned shopping malls. This bill would permit the\nreasonable exercise of free speech in shopping malls, hereby ensuring\nthat fundamental rights and privileges granted in the past be\nreserved in the future under changing conditions.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATION:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the\nfirst of September\nnext succeeding the date on which it shall have become a law.\n\n",
