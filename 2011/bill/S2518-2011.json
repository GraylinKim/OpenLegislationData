Legislative findings. The legislature hereby finds that the\n    2  public employees' fair employment act, as provided in article 14 of  the\n    3  civil service law, became effective in September of 1967 and has been in\n    4  effect  for  over 40 years. Representatives of both public employees and\n    5  employers have raised questions about the current law causing the legis-\n    6  lature to query whether  the  law,  as  currently  enacted,  effectively\n    7  addresses labor relations between public employers and public employees.\n    8  The legislature, therefore, deems it appropriate to review and study the\n    9  provisions  of  the  act  and  if  necessary, make recommendations as to\n   10  amendments that will improve  relations  between  public  employers  and\n   11  employees,  while  better  protecting the interests of public employees,\n   12  the state, public employers and the residents of New York state.\n   13    S 2.
