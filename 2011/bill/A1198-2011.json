Section 1 of part LL-1 of chapter 57 of the laws  of  2008,\n    2  relating to directing the commissioner of taxation and finance to insti-\n    3  tute a re-registration program, is amended to read as follows:\n    4    Section  1.    The commissioner of taxation and finance is directed to\n    5  institute a re-registration program pursuant to section 1134 of the  tax\n    6  law,  which  program  should  be completed by March 31, 2012.  [Notwith-\n    7  standing any law to the  contrary,  every  certificate  of  registration\n    8  filed  pursuant  to this re-registration program by a person required to\n    9  file sales and compensating use tax returns for the monthly or quarterly\n   10  periods described in section 1136 of the tax law must be accompanied  by\n   11  a  50  dollar application fee to constitute a complete application.

Notwithstanding section 1148 of the tax law,  or  any\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD01499-01-1\n\n       A. 1198                             2\n\n    1  other law to the contrary, such commissioner must retain from the appli-\n    2  cation  fees  collected  or  received  an  amount that such commissioner\n    3  determines is necessary to cover reasonable costs of  such  commissioner\n    4  in  implementing,  administering and enforcing registrations pursuant to\n    5  this section, but no more than the amount of those fees. The  provisions\n    6  of subdivisions (a) and (c) of section 1139 of the tax law apply, except\n    7  that  no  interest  is  allowed  or paid on any refund.] A person may be\n    8  subject to the re-registration program directed by this section even  if\n    9  such person holds a certificate of authority that has not been in effect\n   10  for a period of at least three years.\n   11    S  2.

Paragraph 5 of subdivision (a) of section 1134 of the tax law, as\n   18  amended by chapter 2 of the laws of 1995, is amended to read as follows:\n   19    (5) If the commissioner considers it necessary for the proper adminis-\n   20  tration of the sales and use taxes and prepaid  taxes  imposed  by  this\n   21  article  and  pursuant  to  the authority of article twenty-nine of this\n   22  chapter, it may require every  person  under  this  section  or  section\n   23  twelve  hundred  fifty-three  of this chapter who holds a certificate of\n   24  authority to file a new certificate of registration, WITHOUT CHARGE, AND\n   25  in such form and at such time as the commissioner may prescribe  and  to\n   26  surrender  such  certificate  of authority. The commissioner may require\n   27  such filing and such surrender not more  often  than  once  every  three\n   28  years.  Upon  the  filing  of  such  certificate of registration and the\n   29  surrender of such  certificate  of  authority,  the  commissioner  shall\n   30  issue, within such time as the commissioner may prescribe, a new certif-\n   31  icate  of  authority, without charge, to each registrant and a duplicate\n   32  thereof for each additional place of business of such registrant.\n   33    S 4.
