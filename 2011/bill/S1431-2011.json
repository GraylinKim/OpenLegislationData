  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1431\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the military law, in relation to the presentation of a flag of\nthe United States to the person designated to dispose of the remains of\ncertain members of the organized militia\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo provide a burial flag of the United States for veterans of\nthe New York Guard.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nSection 1 - Amends section 250-a of the military law by adding a new\nparagraph b, which would provide a flag of the United States to\ndeceased veterans of the New York Guard for whom a flag is not\nprovided by the United States.\nSection 2 - Sets an immediate effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThis legislation provides statutory authority to the\nAdjutant General to present a burial flag to those who have honorably\nserved in the New York Guard. When an individual enlists in the New\nYork Guard, he or she accepts responsibility to serve the State in\ntimes of emergency. Additionally, if their unit is activated by the\nPresident they are prepared to serve their country, at home or\nabroad. Federal law furnishes flags to State Guard veterans only if\nthey have been activated and called to serve abroad. If an individual\nis prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for their country, and has\nhonorably fulfilled the terms of duty, the State should honor them\nappropriately. Currently, the Military Funeral Honors Program of the\nNew York State Division of Military and Naval Affairs provides a flag\nupon request, but since there is no statutory authority for them to\ndo so, many are unaware that a flag may be requested.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-2010: S. 1255 - Referred to Veterans, Homeland Security, and\nMilitary Affairs.\n2007-2008: S.7515 -- Passed Senate.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nThis service is currently provided by the\nMilitary Funeral Honors Program of the New York State Division of\nMilitary and Naval Affairs without statutory authority.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
