  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1980\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public service law, in relation to the management and\noperations audits of certain utilities\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nIn its January 2007 report, the\nAssembly Queens power outage Task Force recommended several measures\nto improve oversight of utilities and prevent future blackouts. This\nbill strengthens the requirements for management and operations\naudits of gas and electric corporations, in order to ensure timely\nawareness of areas where improvements in utility operations may be\nneeded.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nBill &sect;1 amends subdivision 19 of &sect;66 of the\nPublic Service Law to make the following revisions to the\nstatutorily required process for management and operations audits of\nelectric and gas corporations:\n\n* the audit schedule - currently at least once every 5 years - could\nbe accelerated by the Public Service Commission (PSC);\n\n* audits would be expanded to include not only construction program\nplanning, but also \"maintenance operations\";\n\n* upon completion, copies of audits must be provided to the Governor\nand Legislature; and\n\n* auditors shall independently verify information provided by the\nutility.\n\nEFFECTS OF PRESENT LAW WHICH THIS BILL WOULD ALTER:\nThis bill makes\nseveral augmentations to the current statutorily required audit\nprocess, as detailed above.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nLast summer, the western part of Queens suffered a\nmassive power outage that lasted 9 days. The Assembly Queens Power\noutage Task Force studied the outage's causes and the inadequate\nresponses by the company responsible for the transmission and\ndistribution system, Consolidated Edison, and by the Public Service\nCommission.\nOne underlying cause of this debacle was found to be the reliance by\nNew York's utility regulators on antiquated laws, regulations and\npolicies that let companies engaged in energy transmission and\ndistribution operate without effective oversight.\n\nThe Task Force found that the legislatively-required schedule for PSC\naudits of the management and operations of certain utilities was not\nbeing met. This bill strengthens the current audit provisions by\nincluding review of a utility's maintenance and security programs and\nindependent verification of information provided by the company,\nallows the PSC to order audits more frequently than every 5 years,\nand requires copies of completed audits to be filed with the Governor\nand Legislature.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nNone.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThe 120th day after becoming law;\nprovided, however,\nthat the Public Service Commission is authorized to promulgate any\nrules and regulations and take any other actions necessary for\nimplementation in advance of such date.\n\n",
