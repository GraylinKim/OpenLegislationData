  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2461\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the executive law, in relation to requiring state agencies\nwhich issue licenses, registrations, permits and/or certifications to\nannually report on the periods of time taken to process each application\ntherefor\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nRequires state agencies to annually report to the public on the time\nperiods for processing applications, of each type of permit, license,\nregistration and certification.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 defines permit and state agency.\n\nSection 2 requires state agencies that process 100 or more permits in\na calendar year to publish a report for all permits it processes,\nincluding the average time for each permit and the shortest and\nlongest time for each permit.\n\nSection 3 requires the report to be submitted to the Executive and the\nLegislature and be posted on each state agency's internet homepage.\n\nSection 4 requires the information from Section two to be printed on\nthe application for each type of permit.\n\nSection 5 requires state agencies to process permits within 134% of\nthe average time for that permit. If they fail to do so, they must\nrefund the permit fee to the applicant.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nState agencies are currently in no way accountable to the consumers\nand taxpayers who fund their operation.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nMany state agencies, notably the State Liquor Authority (SLA) and the\nState Education Department (SED), have large backlogs for various\npermits. Yet many New Yorkers depend upon these agencies for permits\nnecessary to get a job, run a business or enjoy recreational\nactivities.\nIt's only fair to these applicants that the state provide them with\nsome expectation of how long they'll have to wait. When people's\nlivelihoods are depending on these permits, it's not unreasonable for\nthe State to inform them of a likely processing time.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.524  of 2010: Referred to Finance\nS.7132 of 2008: Passed Senate\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nMinimal.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take on the first of April next succeeding the date\non which it shall have become law.\n\n",
