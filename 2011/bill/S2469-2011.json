  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2469\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act to amend the criminal procedure law, and the social services law\nin relation to authorizing the review of sealed juvenile records for\npersons applying to serve as a foster or adoptive parent\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nTo ensure that prospective foster and adoptive parents or those seeking\nemployment from licensed caregivers receive a thorough background check\nthat includes juvenile convictions for sex offenses.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1. Section 720.35 of the criminal procedure law is amended by\nadding a new subdivision 5 to require that all records and reports\nrelated to a sex offense conviction as a youthful offender shall be\nprovided to the commissioner of children and family services in order to\nperform background checks.\n\nSection 2. Subdivision 2 of section 378-a of the social services law is\namended by adding a new paragraph (a-1) that mandates a review of the\nyouthful offender records referenced above as a part of the background\ncheck process for foster and adoptive parents or employed by a licensed\ncaregiver.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nWhile New York State Law provides stringent background check guidelines\nfor prospective adoptive and foster parents or those seeking employment\nwith a licensed caregiver, these guidelines do not allow a review of\nconvictions that may have occurred as a youthful offender. This bill\nwould close a dangerous loophole in the law that allows individuals who\ncommitted criminal sex offenses as a minor to hide those convictions\nfrom the office of children and family services when records are\nreviewed pursuant to an adoption or foster parenting situation or when\nseeking employment from a licensed caregiver. This bill will allow the\nCommissioner of Children and Family Services in each county in New York\nState to examine any youthful offender conviction for a sex offense\nbefore deciding if an individual is fit to serve as a foster or adoptive\nparent or be employed by a licensed caregiver.\n\nSadly, we have seen cases around the State including in Western New\nYork, where individuals have committed sex offenses as juveniles, and\nstill been allowed to act as a foster or adoptive parent or work in a\ndaycare setting.  This situation is unacceptable because it places chil-\ndren in harm's way. This bill would ensure that these types of situ-\nations never happen again.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nThis is a new bill.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
