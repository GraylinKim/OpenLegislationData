CANESTRARI, ORTIZ -- Multi-Sponsored by -- M. of\n         A. COOK, LATIMER, McENENY -- read once and referred to  the  Committee\n         on Higher Education\n\n       AN ACT to amend the civil practice law and rules, in relation to provid-\n         ing  a statute of limitations for certain actions against professional\n         engineers,  architects,  landscape  architects,  land  surveyors   and\n         construction  contractors and to repeal section 214-d, subdivision (h)\n         of rule 3211 and subdivision (i) of rule 3212 of  the  civil  practice\n         law and rules relating thereto\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Statement of findings and purpose.  The  legislature  finds\n    2  that (a) the open-ended and continuing liability imposed upon members of\n    3  the  design  professions  and  construction  contractors, due to alleged\n    4  deficiencies relating to improvements to real property, has resulted  in\n    5  an  unfair  burden  on  such professionals and a general increase in the\n    6  cost of both public and private improvements to real property,  (b)  the\n    7  cost  of  maintaining adequate insurance coverage is so expensive that a\n    8  significant number of design professionals and construction  contractors\n    9  are  forced  to forego insurance coverage altogether to the detriment of\n   10  the public's safety and welfare. The legislature further finds that  the\n   11  best designed and constructed improvement is dependent upon proper main-\n   12  tenance  to  preserve  its integrity and safety and it is thus of impor-\n   13  tance to the public safety and welfare to ensure than an owner maintains\n   14  and repairs that which is the property of  the  owner.  The  legislature\n   15  therefore  finds  that it is necessary and desirable to establish a time\n   16  limit after which tort claims for personal injury or wrongful death  may\n   17  not be asserted against such professionals and contractors. That statute\n   18  of  repose  set forth herein, with a claim accruing on the date that the\n   19  improvement was completed, will preserve the liability  of  the  profes-\n   20  sional and contractor during a period in which the defects, if any, will\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD06090-01-1\n\n       A. 2475                             2\n\n    1  be  revealed,  and  therefore  will  establish  an  appropriate limit on\n    2  liability, while affording adequate protection to the public.\n    3    S 2. Section 214-d of the civil practice law and rules is REPEALED and\n    4  a new section 214-d is added to read as follows:\n    5    S  214-D.  LIMITATIONS  ON  CERTAIN ACTIONS AGAINST PROFESSIONAL ENGI-\n    6  NEERS, ARCHITECTS, LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS, LAND SURVEYORS OR  CONSTRUCTION\n    7  CONTRACTORS.  1.
