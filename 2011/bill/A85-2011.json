RIVERA,  THIELE,  WEISENBERG,\n         WRIGHT -- read once and referred to the Committee on Health\n\n       AN  ACT  to  amend  the  education law, the insurance law and the public\n         health law, in relation to providing for dispensing emergency  contra-\n         ception under certain conditions\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as\n    2  the \"unintended pregnancy prevention act\".\n    3    S  2.  Legislative  findings. The United States Food and Drug Adminis-\n    4  tration (FDA) has declared emergency contraceptive pills to be safe  and\n    5  effective in preventing pregnancy when used within 72 hours after unpro-\n    6  tected  intercourse. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecolo-\n    7  gists and the American College of Nurse-Midwives  state  that  emergency\n    8  contraception  (EC)  is  so  safe, and using it quickly is so important,\n    9  that it should be available over the counter,  without  a  prescription.\n   10  They also emphasize the need for unimpeded access to EC for all women of\n   11  reproductive  age.  However,  although  there  are no medical reasons to\n   12  limit provision of EC, the FDA only approved non-prescription access for\n   13  women 18 years and older. Additionally, the FDA imposed requirements for\n   14  proving the patient's  identity  with  government-issued  identification\n   15  documents.  The  need  remains,  however, to provide access to women who\n   16  have difficulty obtaining the required identification documents  and  to\n   17  women under the age of 17 years. Minors in New York State have long been\n   18  legally entitled to full access, without parental consent, to all repro-\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD00900-01-1\n\n       A. 85                               2\n\n    1  ductive  health care and services, including EC. Providing direct access\n    2  to EC for younger women will also make it more  likely  that  they  will\n    3  receive  appropriate  and  timely  professional  attention,  support and\n    4  assistance.\n    5    The legislature deems it necessary to create a structure for simplify-\n    6  ing  access  to  EC for these women, while respecting and preserving the\n    7  prescribing scopes of practice of physicians, nurse  practitioners,  and\n    8  midwives,  the treating and case-finding scope of practice of registered\n    9  professional nurses, and the dispensing scope  of  practice  of  pharma-\n   10  cists.  This act does not alter the scopes of such professions, nor does\n   11  this legislation interfere with non-prescription access to EC  where  it\n   12  is otherwise lawful.\n   13    The  legislature  also  finds  that  this  legislation is necessary to\n   14  ensure that women do not lose insurance coverage for EC  solely  because\n   15  it has become available without a prescription. Losing coverage would be\n   16  a  major  obstacle to access, which would undermine the important health\n   17  objectives of the FDA and the legislature.\n   18    S 3. Subdivision 6 of section 6527 of the education law, as  added  by\n   19  chapter  573  of the laws of 1999, paragraph (c) as added by chapter 221\n   20  of the laws of 2002 and paragraph (d) as added by  chapter  429  of  the\n   21  laws of 2005, is amended to read as follows:\n   22    6.
