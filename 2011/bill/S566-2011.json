This act shall be known and may be cited as the \"childhood\n    2  lead poisoning primary prevention and safe housing act\".\n    3    S 2. Legislative findings and purposes. 1. (a) Lead poisoning of chil-\n    4  dren persists as one of the most prevalent and preventable environmental\n    5  diseases in New York. At least 10,000  children  were  newly  identified\n    6  with levels of lead in their blood at 10 micrograms per deciliter in New\n    7  York  state  in  2001.  Moreover,  only  about one-third of children are\n    8  receiving the lead screenings that are required by  law  and  therefore,\n    9  the  actual  number  of  children  affected  by the ingestion of lead is\n   10  undoubtedly significantly greater than reported. Prevention is the  only\n   11  effective way to protect children from irreversible damage.  Unless lead\n   12  poisoning  is  prevented,  elevated  blood  lead  levels  will result in\n   13  impairment of the ability to think, concentrate, and learn.\n   14    (b) Medical research indicates that  children  can  suffer  permanent,\n   15  irreparable  damage  at  blood  levels even lower than 10 micrograms per\n   16  deciliter, and that there is no level of lead ingestion which is without\n   17  adverse impact. Medical research also indicates that fetal injuries from\n   18  lead paint can occur if women have elevated blood levels during pregnan-\n   19  cy. Because of this, intervention measures that wait until children have\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD02070-01-1\n\n       S. 566                              2\n\n    1  been  exposed  have  limited  benefits,  and  the  pursuit  of   primary\n    2  prevention,  which  means  eliminating  lead hazards before children are\n    3  exposed, has been recommended by the United States centers  for  disease\n    4  control and prevention and promoted by leading experts in the field as a\n    5  critical course of action to protect the health of young children.\n    6    (c)  The predominant cause of lead poisoning in children is the inges-\n    7  tion of lead particles from deteriorating or  abraded  lead-based  paint\n    8  from older and poorly maintained residences.\n    9    (d) Deteriorating lead-based paint or excessive amounts of lead-conta-\n   10  minated dust in these poorly maintained homes endangers the intellectual\n   11  and  emotional development and physical well being of affected children.\n   12  In addition, unsafe work practices that inadequately control  lead  dust\n   13  in  the  repair  or renovation of older homes can cause substantial lead\n   14  hazards.\n   15    (e) Although lead-based paint was banned for residential use in  1978,\n   16  New  York state has both the largest percentage and the largest absolute\n   17  number of older housing units with lead paint in the nation.\n   18    (f) The dangers posed by lead-based paint can be substantially reduced\n   19  by taking measures to prevent paint  deterioration  and  limiting  chil-\n   20  dren's exposure to paint chips and lead dust.\n   21    (g)  The deterioration of lead-based paint in older residences results\n   22  in increased expenses each year for the state of New York in the form of\n   23  special education and other education expenses, medical care  for  lead-\n   24  poisoned  children,  and  expenditures  for  delinquent youth and others\n   25  needing special supervision.\n   26    (h) Older housing units remain an important part of New York's housing\n   27  stock, particularly for those of modest or limited incomes. The  problem\n   28  of  lead-based  paint in housing affects urban, suburban and rural areas\n   29  of the state.\n   30    (i) The existing housing codes and enforcement systems in most  juris-\n   31  dictions do not include primary prevention measures for lead hazards and\n   32  have  proven  ineffective  in  encouraging  widespread  lead-based paint\n   33  hazard abatement, mitigation, and control.\n   34    (j) The financial incentives currently in place have not proven suffi-\n   35  cient to motivate property owners to undertake widespread and  effective\n   36  lead-based paint hazard abatement, mitigation, and control; moreover low\n   37  and moderate income property owners may not have access to the resources\n   38  to eliminate or control lead hazards.\n   39    (k)  Knowledge of lead-based paint hazards, their control, mitigation,\n   40  abatement, and risk avoidance is not sufficiently widespread, especially\n   41  outside urban areas.\n   42    2. The purposes of this act are: (a) to increase the supply of afford-\n   43  able rental housing in the state of New York in which measures have been\n   44  taken to eliminate or substantially reduce the risk  of  childhood  lead\n   45  poisoning;\n   46    (b)  to  ensure  that  New York's response to lead-based paint hazards\n   47  focuses on primary prevention as the essential tool to combat  childhood\n   48  lead  poisoning, and thus to substantially reduce, and eventually elimi-\n   49  nate, the incidence of childhood lead poisoning  in  the  state  of  New\n   50  York;\n   51    (c)  to  improve public awareness of lead safety issues and to educate\n   52  both property owners and tenants about practices  that  can  reduce  the\n   53  incidence of lead poisoning;\n   54    (d)  to provide access to the resources for property owners who commit\n   55  to undertake specified lead hazard reduction measures.\n\n       S. 566                              3\n\n    1    S 3.
