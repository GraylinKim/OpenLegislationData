  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1764\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public health law, the vehicle and traffic law and the\nstate finance law, in relation to establishing the save our sight\nprogram and the save our sight fund\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo establish the \"Save Our Sight Program\" and the \"Save Our Sight\nFund\" to help raise funds for vision screening programs to detect\nvision problems in children.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 amends the Public Health Law by adding a new Section 22\nwhereby the Health Commissioner in conjunction with the Motor\nVehicles Commissioner establishes a \"Save Our Sight Program.\" The\nprogram will provide support to nonprofit organizations that offer\nvision screening and education services, as well as implement a\nvoluntary children's vision screening training and certification\nprogram for caregivers and teachers; track amblyopia treatment in\nchildren; establish a matching grant program for the purchase of\nprotective eye wear for children; and provide vision health and\nsafety program materials to classrooms.\n\nSection 2 amends the Vehicle and Traffic Law by adding a new Section\n401-c that establishes a program whereby people applying for or\nrenewing motor vehicle registrations or driver licenses may\nvoluntarily contribute $1 to the \"Save Our Sight Fund.\"\n\nSection 3 amends the State Finance Law by adding a new Section 81 to\ncreate the \"Save Our Sight\nFund.\" All monies of the fund shall be made available from the State\nComptroller to the\nCommissioner of the Department of Health for the \"Save Our Sight\nProgram\".\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThis legislation would provide for a $1 voluntary check-off box on\nmotor vehicle and driver\nlicense registration and renewal forms. Contributions raised would be\nadministered by the\nDepartment of Health to support programs to help detect and prevent\nblindness in children.\n\nGreater attention needs to be paid to the vision of children, as\nvision disorders are one of the most prevalent disabilities among\nyouth. Untreated eye problems, such as amblyopia (lazy eye), eye\ninjuries, muscle imbalances and color blindness in children can lead\nto difficulties in learning and behavior as well as eventual\nblindness. Since, according to Prevent Blindness, vision problems\naffect one in twenty preschoolers and one in four school-age\nchildren, screening should be widespread. Also, treatment is most\nsuccessful when problems are detected early. Yet, approximately 80\npercent of children under age six (more than 1.3 million New York\nchildren) are not being screened for vision problems before they\n\n\nenter school. This legislation provides for an easy mechanism to\nraise funds for a vision screening program.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-10: S.1126 - Referred to Health; Reported and Committed to Finance\n2007-08: S.2926 - Referred to Health\n2005-06: S.1467 - Referred to Health\n2003-04: S.1984 - Referred to Health\n2001-02: S.1499 - Referred to Health\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
