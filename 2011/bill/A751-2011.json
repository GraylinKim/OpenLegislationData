Such agreement shall\n   25  provide, in the event a facility,  operation,  right  or  obligation  is\n   26  necessary and material to the provision of rail passenger service in the\n   27  district  or  is  not  assignable  under  applicable  bond  covenants or\n   28  contracts or the parties agree that it should not be assigned, that  the\n   29  authority  or subsidiary thereof shall continue to hold and be responsi-\n   30  ble for such facility, operation, right  or  obligation  and  that  such\n   31  county  shall reimburse to the authority that portion of the cost to the\n   32  authority or subsidiary of its retention of  such  facility,  operation,\n   33  right  or  obligation  that is allocable [to] WITHIN such county. If the\n   34  parties agree that the authority or subsidiary thereof shall operate the\n   35  railroad facilities in a county after the effective date of  such  coun-\n   36  ty's  withdrawal,  the  agreement  also  shall provide for the terms and\n   37  conditions of the operation of such service.\n   38    3.
