Any purchaser who furnishes to his seller a false or frau-\n   24  dulent exempt transaction certificate for the purpose of establishing an\n   25  exemption  from  the  tax imposed by section two hundred eighty-two-a of\n   26  this article shall be jointly and severally liable for the  tax  imposed\n   27  by  such  section.  In  lieu  of  an exempt transaction certificate, the\n   28  commissioner [of taxation and finance] may provide for the establishment\n   29  of such exemption by means of a procedure or other document which he  OR\n   30  SHE  deems  appropriate so as to secure the revenues from the excise tax\n   31  on Diesel motor fuel.  Provided, further, in the case of  the  exemption\n   32  provided  by  subparagraph  (i) of paragraph (b) of subdivision three of\n   33  section two hundred eighty-two-a of this article, the commissioner shall\n   34  provide for an alternative procedure or other document  signed  only  by\n   35  the  seller, such as a metered delivery ticket, for the establishment of\n   36  such exemption in those cases where such commissioner is satisfied  that\n   37  the  use  of such alternative procedure or other document will not jeop-\n   38  ardize the revenues from the excise tax on Diesel motor fuel.\n   39    (b) A claim for the exemption from tax provided  for  in  subparagraph\n   40  [(ii)  or  (viii)]  (V) of paragraph (b) of subdivision three of section\n   41  two hundred eighty-two-a of this article shall be established  by  means\n   42  of  an  interdistributor sale certificate. If such exemption is applica-\n   43  ble, such certificate shall be provided by the purchaser to  the  seller\n   44  at  the  time  of  or  prior  to delivery of the Diesel motor fuel. Such\n   45  certificate shall set forth the name and address of the  purchaser,  the\n   46  purchaser's  registration  number, an affirmation by such purchaser that\n   47  the purchaser is registered as a distributor and that such  registration\n   48  has not been suspended or cancelled and shall be signed by such purchas-\n   49  er and by the seller. Such certificate shall be in such form and contain\n   50  such  other  information  as  the commissioner [of taxation and finance]\n   51  shall require. Where a proper and complete interdistributor sale certif-\n   52  icate has been furnished and accepted by the seller in good faith,  such\n   53  certificate  under  such  circumstance  shall  relieve the seller of the\n   54  burden of proving that the Diesel motor fuel covered by such certificate\n   55  is exempt from tax by reason of subparagraph [(ii)  or  (viii)]  (V)  of\n   56  paragraph  (b)  of subdivision three of such section two hundred eighty-\n\n       S. 2811                            48                            A. 4011\n\n    1  two-a. For purposes of this paragraph, a seller shall not have  accepted\n    2  such certificate in good faith if the purchaser's registration is inval-\n    3  id  because  it  has been suspended or cancelled, or if the purchaser is\n    4  not  registered,  and  the  commissioner  [of  taxation and finance] has\n    5  furnished registered distributors with information identifying all those\n    6  persons then validly registered as distributors of Diesel motor fuel and\n    7  those persons whose registrations have been suspended or cancelled.  Any\n    8  purchaser  who  furnishes  to his seller a false or fraudulent interdis-\n    9  tributor sale certificate for the purpose of establishing  an  exemption\n   10  from the tax imposed by section two hundred eighty-two-a of this article\n   11  shall  be  jointly  and  severally  liable  for  the tax imposed by such\n   12  section.\n   13    S 9.

Every person who stores motor fuel  or  diesel\n   25  motor  fuel shall keep a complete and accurate record of the identity of\n   26  the person for whom such fuel is stored, the quantity and type  of  fuel\n   27  so stored, the identity of the person to whom such fuel is released from\n   28  storage  and  the  quantity  and  type of fuel so released. Such records\n   29  shall be in such form and contain such other information as the  commis-\n   30  sioner  shall  prescribe. Said commissioner, by rule or regulation, also\n   31  may require the delivery of statements to purchasers  with  consignments\n   32  of  motor  fuel  or diesel motor fuel or such ingredients, and prescribe\n   33  the matters to be contained therein. Such records and statements, unless\n   34  required by the commissioner to be preserved for a longer period,  shall\n   35  be  preserved  for  a  period  of  three  years and shall be offered for\n   36  inspection at any time upon oral or written demand by such  commissioner\n   37  or the commissioner's duly authorized agents.

To verify the\n   41  amount of tax due  under  this  article,  each  such  person  is  hereby\n   42  directed  and required to give to the commissioner or the commissioner's\n   43  duly authorized representatives, the means, facilities  and  opportunity\n   44  for  such examinations as are herein provided for and required.  Nothing\n   45  CONTAINED in this section [contained] shall be construed to require  the\n   46  keeping  for  purposes of this article of a record of purchases or sales\n   47  of motor fuel or diesel motor fuel or  such  ingredients  at  retail  in\n   48  small  quantities  (less than thirty gallons) or of motor fuel or diesel\n   49  motor fuel imported into this state in the tank of a motor vehicle which\n   50  supplies the fuel for its operation.\n   51    S 10.

Transportation  of  [automotive] MOTOR FUEL OR DIESEL MOTOR\n   14  fuel; manifest required. 1. The master or other person in charge of  any\n   15  barge, tanker or other vessel in which [automotive] MOTOR FUEL OR DIESEL\n   16  MOTOR fuel is being transported over any of the navigable waters of this\n   17  state,  the operator of a motor vehicle in which [automotive] MOTOR FUEL\n   18  OR DIESEL MOTOR fuel is being transported in this state, or the operator\n   19  of a pipeline through which [automotive] MOTOR FUEL OR DIESEL MOTOR fuel\n   20  is being transported in this state, other than [automotive]  MOTOR  FUEL\n   21  OR  DIESEL  MOTOR fuel being transported for use in operating the engine\n   22  which propels such vessel or motor vehicle, as the  case  may  be,  must\n   23  have  in  his  OR  HER  possession  a  manifest which shows the name and\n   24  address of the person from whom such [automotive] fuel was  received  by\n   25  him  OR  HER  and  the  place  of  receipt of such fuel and the name and\n   26  address of every person to whom he OR SHE is to  make  delivery  of  the\n   27  same  and  the place of delivery, together with the number of gallons to\n   28  be delivered to each such person, and,  if  such  [automotive]  fuel  is\n   29  being  imported into the state in such vessel, motor vehicle or pipeline\n   30  for use, storage, distribution or sale in the state,  the  name  of  the\n   31  distributor importing or causing such fuel to be imported into the state\n   32  and  such  other  information  as  the [tax commission] COMMISSIONER may\n   33  require pursuant to rule or regulation, and shall at the  request  of  a\n   34  peace  officer,  acting  pursuant to his OR HER special duties, a police\n   35  officer, any representative of the department [of taxation and  finance]\n   36  or any other person authorized by law to inquire into or investigate the\n   37  transportation  of  such  [automotive]  fuel,  produce such manifest for\n   38  inspection.

The\n   43  absence of the manifest required by this section shall give  rise  to  a\n   44  presumption  that the [automotive] MOTOR FUEL OR DIESEL MOTOR fuel being\n   45  transported is intended for sale, use, distribution or storage  in  this\n   46  state  and  is  being  imported or caused to be imported by other than a\n   47  registered distributor.

Subdivision 1 of section 287 of the tax law, as amended by chap-\n   19  ter 261 of the laws of 1988, is amended to read as follows:\n   20    1. Every distributor shall, on or before the  twentieth  day  of  each\n   21  month,   file with the department [of taxation and finance] a return, on\n   22  forms to be prescribed by the commissioner and furnished by such depart-\n   23  ment, stating the number of gallons of motor fuel imported, manufactured\n   24  or sold by such distributor in the state during the  preceding  calendar\n   25  month  and  in  the  case of Diesel motor fuel, the number of gallons of\n   26  [enhanced] Diesel motor fuel imported[, the number of gallons  enhanced]\n   27  and the number of gallons which have been sold or used.

Such returns shall  contain  such\n   38  further  information as the commissioner shall require.  The fact that a\n   39  distributor's name is signed to a filed  return  shall  be  prima  facie\n   40  evidence  for  all  purposes that the return was actually signed by such\n   41  distributor.  Each such distributor shall, with respect to  motor  fuel,\n   42  pay  to the department with the filing of such return, the taxes imposed\n   43  by this article on each gallon of motor fuel imported,  manufactured  or\n   44  sold by such distributor in the state, and so reported, during the peri-\n   45  od  covered  by  such  return.

Every  such  claim  shall\n   22  include  a  certificate by or on behalf of the party presenting the same\n   23  to the effect that it is just, true and correct, that  no  part  thereof\n   24  has  been  paid,  except as stated therein, and that the balance therein\n   25  stated is actually due and owing. The claimant shall satisfy the depart-\n   26  ment that the claimant has borne the tax and that  the  motor  fuel  has\n   27  been  consumed by the claimant in a manner other than the operation of a\n   28  motor vehicle upon or over the PUBLIC highways of this state, the opera-\n   29  tion of a pleasure or recreational motorboat upon or over the  waterways\n   30  of  the state including waterways bordering on the state or, in the case\n   31  of an omnibus carrier, taxicab licensee, nonpublic  school  operator  or\n   32  volunteer  ambulance  service,  that  the claimant has borne the tax and\n   33  that the amount claimed is the amount of  such  tax  reimbursable  under\n   34  paragraph  (b),  (d),  (e)  or  (f)  of  THIS subdivision [three of this\n   35  section]. The department may require such further information  or  proof\n   36  as  it shall deem necessary for the administration of such claim. Claims\n   37  for reimbursement approved by the department shall be paid from revenues\n   38  collected under this article and deposited to the credit  of  the  comp-\n   39  troller as hereinafter provided; but no such claims shall be paid unless\n   40  the  department  is  satisfied  that the amount of the tax for which the\n   41  reimbursement is claimed has actually been collected by the state.   The\n   42  amount  of  any  erroneous  or  excessive  payment  to  a  claimant  for\n   43  reimbursement may be determined by the department and may  be  recovered\n   44  from  such claimant in the same manner as a tax imposed by this article,\n   45  provided, however, that any such  determination  shall  be  made  within\n   46  three years after the date of such erroneous or excessive payment.\n   47    S 14.

If the department [of  taxa-\n   55  tion  and finance] fails to make such motion within the required period,\n   56  such seized property shall be restored to the owners thereof as provided\n\n       S. 2811                            88                            A. 4011\n\n    1  in subdivision (e) of this section. On a motion for an order  confirming\n    2  the  seizure,  the  department  [of taxation and finance] shall show, by\n    3  affidavit and such other written evidence  as  may  be  submitted,  that\n    4  there  is a cause of action for forfeiture under subdivision (d) of this\n    5  section and that there are grounds for confirmation of the seizure.  The\n    6  department  shall  include,  in  its  motion papers, an inventory of all\n    7  seized property. The court shall  grant  an  application  for  an  order\n    8  confirming  the  seizure  when it determines that there is a substantial\n    9  probability that the department [of taxation and finance]  will  prevail\n   10  on the issue of forfeiture.\n   11    (3)  Forfeiture  of  motor fuel OR DIESEL MOTOR FUEL together with the\n   12  vehicle or other means of transportation used to  transport  such  motor\n   13  fuel  OR  DIESEL  MOTOR  FUEL shall be adjudged where the department [of\n   14  taxation and finance] proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that the\n   15  person importing or causing such motor fuel OR DIESEL MOTOR FUEL  to  be\n   16  imported  was  not registered as a distributor under section two hundred\n   17  eighty-three OR SECTION TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY-TWO-A of this chapter, AS THE\n   18  CASE MAY BE. All defendants in a forfeiture action brought  pursuant  to\n   19  this article shall have the right to trial by jury on any issue of fact.\n   20    (D) The court may grant the relief provided in subparagraph (A) [here-\n   21  of]  OF  THIS PARAGRAPH if it finds that such relief is warranted by the\n   22  existence of  some  compelling  factor,  consideration  or  circumstance\n   23  demonstrating that forfeiture of the property or any part thereof, would\n   24  not  serve the ends of justice. Reporting and payment of the tax imposed\n   25  pursuant to article twelve-A or article  twenty-eight  of  this  chapter\n   26  with  respect  to such motor fuel OR DIESEL MOTOR FUEL subsequent to the\n   27  seizure of such fuel shall not constitute a compelling factor, consider-\n   28  ation or circumstance warranting the granting of the relief provided for\n   29  in subparagraph (A) [hereof] of this paragraph.  In determining  whether\n   30  such  relief  is  warranted  by the existence of some compelling factor,\n   31  consideration or circumstances pursuant to  this  paragraph,  the  court\n   32  may, however, take into account the fact that such taxes with respect to\n   33  the  seized  fuel  have been reported and remitted to the state prior to\n   34  the temporary seizure of such fuel if the unregistered importation  into\n   35  the  state  was  effected  in  good  faith  and without knowledge of the\n   36  requirement of registration and without intent to evade tax.  The  court\n   37  must  issue  a  written  decision, stating the basis for an order issued\n   38  pursuant to this paragraph.\n   39    (6) The total that may be recovered shall not exceed the value of  the\n   40  motor  fuel  OR  DIESEL  MOTOR  FUEL seized and, in addition, either the\n   41  value of the vehicle or other means of transportation used to  transport\n   42  such  fuel  or three times the amount of the tax and penalty under arti-\n   43  cles twelve-A, thirteen-A and twenty-eight and pursuant to the authority\n   44  of article twenty-nine of this chapter with respect to the motor fuel OR\n   45  DIESEL MOTOR FUEL, whichever is less.\n   46    (e) Return of  property.  If  (1)  the  department  [of  taxation  and\n   47  finance]  fails  to  move  for  confirmation  of the seizure pursuant to\n   48  subdivision (c) of this section or (2) a court denies an application for\n   49  an order confirming the seizure or (3) judgment is entered  against  the\n   50  department  in the forfeiture action and that judgment is affirmed after\n   51  all appeals are exhausted, then the department shall restore such seized\n   52  motor fuel OR DIESEL MOTOR FUEL, or motor fuel OR DIESEL MOTOR FUEL of a\n   53  like quantity and type, or such seized vehicle or other means of  trans-\n   54  portation  to  the  owners  thereof. Alternatively, if such seized motor\n   55  fuel OR DIESEL MOTOR FUEL has been sold as provided in  subdivision  (b)\n   56  of  this  section,  the department shall pay to the owners of such motor\n\n       S. 2811                            89                            A. 4011\n\n    1  fuel OR DIESEL MOTOR FUEL the proceeds of such sale or, if  greater,  an\n    2  amount  of money representing the fair market value of the motor fuel OR\n    3  DIESEL MOTOR FUEL at the time of the seizure.\n    4    (g)  Disposal  of  property. The department [of taxation and finance],\n    5  after a judicial determination of forfeiture, shall, in its  discretion,\n    6  either  retain  such  seized  property for its official use or sell such\n    7  forfeited property at public sale. The net proceeds of any such sale, or\n    8  of any sale of seized motor fuel OR DIESEL MOTOR  FUEL  as  provided  in\n    9  subdivision  (b) of this section, after deduction of the lawful expenses\n   10  incurred, shall be deposited and disposed of pursuant to the  provisions\n   11  of  section  one  hundred  seventy-one-a of this chapter with respect to\n   12  deposit and disposition of revenue.\n   13    S 55.
