The tax\n   20  exemption shall not operate for a period of more than twenty-five years,\n   21  commencing in each instance from the date on which the benefits of  such\n   22  exemption  first become available and effective; provided, however, that\n   23  with respect to a project either  acquired  by  a  mutual  redevelopment\n   24  company  pursuant  to  section one hundred twenty-six OF THIS ARTICLE or\n   25  owned and continuing to be owned by a mutual redevelopment company which\n   26  would require substantial increases in carrying charges after the period\n   27  of tax exemption is ended unless relief is provided, the local  legisla-\n   28  tive  body may contract with such mutual redevelopment company to extend\n   29  such tax exemption for not more than twenty-five additional years  at  a\n   30  rate  of  tax  exemption  not  to  exceed an average of fifty per centum\n   31  during such additional period, provided that the  tax  exemption  during\n   32  the first two years of such additional period shall continue at the rate\n   33  of  the  tax  exemption of such project immediately preceding the termi-\n   34  nation of the initial twenty-five year period and that the tax exemption\n   35  thereafter shall be decreased in equal biennial decrements, the first of\n   36  which shall occur  immediately  following  such  two  year  period,  and\n   37  provided  that such contract shall contain provisions as to income limi-\n   38  tations relating to admission and continued occupancy of the project and\n   39  provisions as to rental surcharges to the same effect as  are  contained\n   40  in  subdivisions two, three[,] AND four [and five] of section thirty-one\n   41  OF THIS CHAPTER, except that in the case of projects owned and  continu-\n   42  ing  to  be owned by mutual redevelopment companies, persons or families\n   43  whose probable aggregate annual income does not exceed the median income\n   44  for families of the same size in the same metropolitan area  shall  also\n   45  be  eligible  for admission to the project on the understanding that any\n   46  person or family becoming  eligible  by  reason  hereof  whose  probable\n   47  aggregate annual income at the time of admission or during the period of\n   48  occupancy exceeds, the greater of (i) the median income for such persons\n   49  or  families  for the metropolitan statistical area in which the project\n   50  is located, or if a project is located outside  a  metropolitan  statis-\n   51  tical area, the median income for such persons or families for the coun-\n   52  ty  in  which the project is located, as most recently determined by the\n   53  United States department of housing and urban development, in which case\n   54  any person or family becoming eligible for admission  pursuant  to  this\n   55  subparagraph  shall  pay, from the time of admission, a rental surcharge\n   56  as provided for in subdivision three of section thirty-one of this chap-\n\n       S. 2081                             3\n\n    1  ter, computed on the basis of the income limitations applicable to  such\n    2  persons  or  families  in  the absence of this subparagraph, or (ii) six\n    3  times the rental shall be liable for payment of rental surcharges  here-\n    4  under  computed  on  the basis of such ratio, except that in the case of\n    5  families with three or more dependents such ratio shall be seven to one;\n    6  and provided further that with respect to a project which is or is to be\n    7  permanently financed by a federally-aided mortgage,  the  tax  exemption\n    8  shall  operate  for  so  long as such mortgage is outstanding, but in no\n    9  event for a period of more than forty years, commencing in each instance\n   10  from the date on which the  benefits  of  such  exemption  first  become\n   11  available  and  effective;  and  provided further that with respect to a\n   12  project which is or is to be permanently financed by a loan from the New\n   13  York city housing development corporation, the tax exemption shall oper-\n   14  ate for so long as such loan is outstanding.\n   15    (a-1) Where the redevelopment contract between a mutual  redevelopment\n   16  company  and  the  local  legislative  body  under which the initial tax\n   17  exemption was granted contains provisions different from those in subdi-\n   18  visions two, three[,] AND four [and five] of section thirty-one of  this\n   19  chapter,  then  a contract to extend the tax exemption for an additional\n   20  period under paragraph (a) of this subdivision may  provide  that  those\n   21  provisions  of  the redevelopment contract shall continue to apply (with\n   22  such modifications as the supervising agency of such  mutual  redevelop-\n   23  ment  company  shall  approve)  during  the additional period as if such\n   24  additional period were the initial period  of  tax  exemption  for  such\n   25  mutual  redevelopment  company,  notwithstanding the provisions of para-\n   26  graph (a) of this subdivision to the contrary.\n   27    S 4.
