Senior\ncitizens and disabled citizens who lose an income earning spouse and\nhave been benefiting from th.e SCRIE or DRIE programs, are entitled\nto a redetermination of their rent based on their now lower income.\nUnfortunately, because the re-determination process takes time,\nwidowed seniors or persons with disabilities may be left paying a\nhigher rent than they can now afford. This legislation makes the\nlower re-determined rent retroactive to the date of the loss of\nincome, allowing widowed, low income seniors or persons with\ndisabilities to maintain their apartments.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nThis bill was previously introduced.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to the state.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately; provided that\nthe amendments to section 467-b of the real property tax law made by\nsection one of this act shall be subject to the expiration and\nreversion of such section pursuant to section 17 of chapter 576 of\nthe laws of 1974, as amended, when upon such date the provision of\nsection two of this act shall take effect.\n\n",
