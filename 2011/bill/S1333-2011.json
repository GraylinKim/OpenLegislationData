  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1333\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the election law, in relation to providing for early voting\n\nPURPOSE:\nEstablishes a program of early voting prior to a primary, general, or\nspecial election.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nAmends the New York State Election Law by adding a new section 8-600 to\nprovide for early voting twenty days prior to a primary or general\nelection and eight days prior to a special election.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nCurrent law provides for voting to occur on the first Tuesday following\nthe first Monday in the month of November- Additionally, the State\nconstitution provides for absentee voting prior to election day in\nlimited circumstances, as provided for by statute.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nEarly voting is a progressive concept that has been spreading throughout\nthe country over the last several years in an effort to increase citizen\ninvolvement and turnout in elections. This concept differs from absentee\nvoting in that voters may visit an election official's office, or in\nsome states other satellite voting locations and cast a vote in person\nwithout offering an excuse for not being able to vote on election day.\nThese locations vary and in some states include grocery stores, shopping\nmalls, schools, and libraries. Early voting is generally conducted on\nthe same voting equipment used in the regular election, as opposed to\nabsentee voting, which is conducted on mail-in paper ballots.\n\nThe time period for early voting also varies by state, but in most cases\nis available during a period of 10-14 days before the election and\ngenerally ends the Friday or Saturday immediately preceding the\nelection.\n\nAt this point in time, about half the states, twenty-seven to be exact,\noffer some form of \"no excuse required\" early voting. A specific\nbreakdown of some of the larger states follows with a short description\nof what their statute provides for:\n\nCalifornia - Permits no excuse early voting starting 29 days prior to\nelection See Cal Elect. Code 3018\n\nFlorida - Permits no excuse early voting starting 15 days before an\nelection See Fla Statute Title 9 Ch 101.657\n\nIllinois - Permits no excuse early voting starting 22 days before an\nelection and ending 5 days before the election. A permanent polling\n\nplace for early voting must remain open during the hours of 8:30-4:30\npm. See 10111. Comp Stat. Ann 5/19-1\n\nLouisiana- Permits no excuse early voting starting twelve days from the\nelection and ending six days prior to. See La Rev. Stat. 18-303(B) Maine\n- Permits no excuse required voting. A voter may go in person to vote at\nthe clerk's office as soon as absentee ballots are available (typically\navailable 30-45 days prior). See Maine Rev. Stat. Title 21A 9-753(13)8\n\nNorth Carolina- Referred to as 'one stop voting' with no excuse\nrequired. Begins no earlier than the third Thursday before the election\nand continues through the Saturday before election day. Voter must\nappear at the county board of elections to exercise this option. See N C\nGen. Stat 163-227.2\n\nTexas - Permits no excuse required starting seventeen days before each\nelection and ends four days before each election. See Tex. Elec Code\n81.001\n\nVermont - Permits in person early voting with no excuse required. Voting\nstarts thirty days before the primary or general election. See Vt..\nStat. 17 KS A. 2531\n\nThis bill seeks to introduce early voting to New York by providing a\nmeans in which citizens can vote early at their local board of elections\nup to twenty days before the actual election. In order to exercise this\nprivilege any registered voter can show up at their local board of\nelections, fill out a form similar to that used to request an absentee\nballot and proceed to vote on a voting machine right there at the board.\nThe bill would also allow alternate designations to be used as\nestablished by the local board should the popularity for the program in\nany given county be significant.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2007/08:   S.1425\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the first of January next succeeding the\ndate on which it shall have become a law.\n\n",
