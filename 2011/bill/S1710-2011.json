  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1710\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the insurance law, in relation to prohibiting insurers from\ncanceling, refusing to issue or renew, or charging higher premiums for\nhomeowners' insurance based on the breed of dog owned if the dog\ncompletes an approved obedience course\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nTo limit insurers' ability to summarily cancel insurance coverage,\nraise rates or refuse to renew homeowners insurance policies based on\nthe breed of dog such insured owns.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThe insurance law is amended by adding a new section 342 I. This\nsection provides that no insurer shall refuse to issue or renew,\ncancel, charge or impose an increased rate for such policy based\non harboring a dog or dogs of a specific breed or \"mixed\" breed.\nSection 2 provides that an insurer is not prohibited from refusing to\nissue or renew, cancel, or charge or impose an increased rate for\nsuch policy based on a dog's designation as a \"dangerous dog\"\npursuant to section 121 of the agriculture and markets law. However,\nbefore the insurance company may do any of the above, it must offer\nthe homeowner the opportunity to enroll their dog in an approved\nobedience course. The insurer shall provide the dog 90 days to\nsuccessfully complete such course. If the course lasts longer than 90\ndays the homeowner may show proof that the course lasts longer than\n90 days and shall receive an additional 60 days to complete such\ncourse. If the dog successfully completes a course the insurer is\nprohibited from refusing to issue or renew, cancel, charge or impose\nan increased rate for such policy based upon the designation of such\ndog as dangerous.\n\nEFFECTS OF PRESENT LAW WHICH THIS BILL WOULD ALTER:\nCurrently insurers are allowed to refuse to issue or renew, cancel,\ncharge or impose an increased rate for a homeowners' policy based on\nownership of certain breeds of dog.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nNo species of dog is inherently dangerous. Each dog is a unique\nindividual with a unique personality that is influenced by their own\npersonal experiences and training. When a dog becomes \"dangerous\" it\nis often because their owners encourage aggressiveness or poor\nsocialization with humans or other dogs. A conscientious homeowner\nshould not be punished simply because they own a dog that insurers\nconsider a \"dangerous breed\". While insurance companies will site\nstatistics that certain breeds of dog bite or behave aggressively\nmore than others, each dog is a unique individual who mayor may not\nbecome aggressive. Insurers must allow homeowners the opportunity to\nproperly train a dog through an approved course before being allowed\n\nto refuse to issue, renew, cancel, or charge increased rates. A\nproper training course will encourage good behavior and socialization\nbefore problems start. This is similar to reducing rates when an\ninsured purchases a burglar or car alarm, takes a defensive driving\ncourse etc. When an insured takes steps to ensure that their dog will\nbehave properly, the insurer must recognize these efforts.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.3112 of 2007\n02/23/07 Referred to Insurance\n01/07/09 REFERRED TO INSURANCE\n01/06/10 REFERRED TO INSURANCE\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to all policies\nissued, renewed, modified, altered or amended on or after such\neffective date.\n\n",
