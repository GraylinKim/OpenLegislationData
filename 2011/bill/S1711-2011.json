Legislative findings.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and\n    2  declares  that  recent  advances  in  technologies  associated  with air\n    3  rifles, air pistols and other non-powder guns have resulted in  products\n    4  that  are  substantially  different  than  those common in past decades.\n    5  Changes in materials and techniques used to produce  non-powder  weapons\n    6  and  ammunition, and the development of guns using carbon dioxide cylin-\n    7  ders and external supplies of compressed gas, have resulted in the emer-\n    8  gence of air guns that can approach the velocity and  force  of  weapons\n    9  using  gunpowder.   The continued development of more powerful and accu-\n   10  rate air guns makes it incumbent on the state of New  York  to  reassess\n   11  the adequacy of its laws, rules, regulations and policies to ensure that\n   12  the public interest continues to be served.\n   13    S  2.  (a)  The  division  of criminal justice services shall examine,\n   14  evaluate, review and make recommendations concerning:\n   15    (1) the current state of and anticipated developments in  technologies\n   16  associated  with  the  design,  production  and  use  of air rifles, air\n   17  pistols and other similar non-powder guns, including the ammunition  and\n   18  ancillary equipment therefor;\n   19    (2)  the  current  state  statutes, the current rules, regulations and\n   20  policies of state agencies, and any significant laws, codes, ordinances,\n   21  rules, regulations and policies of municipalities in the state  relating\n   22  to  air rifles, air pistols and other similar non-powder guns, including\n   23  ammunition and ancillary equipment therefor;\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD06087-01-1\n\n       S. 1711                             2\n\n    1    (3) recent developments in statutes, rules, regulations  and  policies\n    2  in other jurisdictions; and\n    3    (4)  the extent to which the statutes, rules, regulations and policies\n    4  reviewed pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision serve the  public\n    5  interest.\n    6    (b) In conducting its examination, evaluation, review and formation of\n    7  recommendations  pursuant  to subdivision (a) of this section, the divi-\n    8  sion of criminal justice services shall consult with the  department  of\n    9  environmental  conservation, the division of state police, the office of\n   10  homeland security and other appropriate state  and  local  agencies  and\n   11  offices, and shall solicit and consider input from the public.\n   12    S  3.  Within one year of the effective date of this act, the division\n   13  of criminal justice services shall make a report to the governor and the\n   14  legislature of its findings, conclusions and recommendations and  shall,\n   15  with  its  report,  submit  such  legislative  proposals and options for\n   16  changes in rules, regulations and policies  as  it  deems  necessary  to\n   17  implement its recommendations.\n   18    S 4.
