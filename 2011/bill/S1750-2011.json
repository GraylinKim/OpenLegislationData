  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1750\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the real property tax law, in relation to a real property tax\nexemption for property owned by certain persons performing active duty\nin a combat zone\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThis bill amends the Real Property Tax Law by adding new section 458-c\nwhich provides, at local option, after public hearings, an exemption\nof 10% of assessed value on primary residences owned by active\nmilitary personnel who have served in a combat zone during the\ntaxable year. It does not apply to portions of the residence not used\nexclusively by the qualifying person or his or her spouse as a\nprimary residence.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThis bill assists in reducing the financial burden experienced by the\nactive military personnel in a combat zone. Many servicemen and women\nhave taken pay cuts from their civilian jobs to serve their country\nin a time of need. These servicemen and women deserve support from\ntheir government and fellow citizens including\nameliorating financial hardship for their families back\nhome. Increased property taxes across this state have imposed greater\nfinancial stress on these men and women engaged in active combat duty.\nA 10% tax exemption on their primary residence is\nwarranted and helps mitigate the increasing tax burdens of home\nownership.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2005 - S.5973/A.9054 - RULES/Real Prop. Tax\n2006 - S.5973/A.9054-B - VETERANS/Vets Affairs\n2007 - S.1311/A.438 - RULES/Vets Affairs\n2008 - S.1311/A.438 - Passed Senate\n2009 - S.2742 - Vets Affairs\n2010 - S.2742 - Vets Affairs\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nThere will be a loss of revenue equal to 10% of the assessed real\nproperty of qualified persons who apply for this exemption.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to real\nproperty having a taxable status date on or after such effective date.\n\n",
