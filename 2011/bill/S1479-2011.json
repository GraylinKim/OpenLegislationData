  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1479\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the general business law, in relation to\nimmigration providers\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\n\nTo establish a licensing requirement of immigration consultants by the\nstate and to protect immigrants from fraudulent immigration\nconsultants.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\n\nThe bill amends General Business Article 28-C (Chapter 463).\n\nThis legislation would grant New York State Department the power to\nissue licenses to immigration providers and require those who act as\nsuch to be so licensed. Licensees would be required to disclose all\nrelevant information to the Department, including any prior\nconvictions, to determine their eligibility for a license. At the\ntime of licensing, they must file with secretary of state a surety\nbond.\n\nIn addition, licensees would be required to display the license\ncertificate and to pay a filing fee. The state also has to make\npublic the list of licensees on its website and upon the re-lest of\nany party.\n\nThe State should also establish a procedure for filing complaints and\ninvestigating the complaint within 30 days of such a complaint. The\nDepartment of State has the power to revoke or suspend such licenses\nupon proof of wrongdoing on the part of the immigration provider.\n\nAny persons aggrieved by the immigration consultants would be entitled\nto relief in the form of a civil action as well as a criminal action.\nThe injured party would be eligible for reasonable attorney fees and\ncosts, including a minimal recovery of five thousand dollars.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nCurrently, there are laws that prohibit immigration providers to\nconduct themselves and advertise themselves as lawyers. However,\nthere is no state regulation of these providers. As the growth of\nimmigrants increase, there is a great need for legislation to prevent\nimmigration providers from taking advantage of these immigrants. Such\nlegislation would act as a safeguard against those who practice\nfraudulent activities\nagainst immigrants for mere economic gains. Furthermore, the\n\nbusiness of immigration consultants is virtually unregulated by the\nstate.\n\nThe state legislation should take active measures to protect against\ncorrupt practices by immigration consultants. These consultants try\nto deprive immigrants of the fundamental liberties which they seek to\nachieve as citizens of our country. Also, corrupt immigration\nconsultants create a negative first impression of the democratic\nprocess by using the immigrants for their own selfish profits at the\nexpense of unwary immigrants. This legislation seeks to regulate the\nbusiness of immigration consultants and to protect immigrants from\nthose who do not have the requisite expertise in or commitment to\nthat business.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n2009-10: S.2283A/A.4430A - CONSUMER PROTECTION/Reported to Codes\n2008:    S.2473\n2006:    S.8133\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nLicensing fees will cover the cost of setting up licensing and\nenforcement.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThe first of January next succeeding the date on which it shall have\nbecome a law, with provisions.\n\n",
