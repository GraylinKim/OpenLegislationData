Jurisdiction; transfer of cases; hearing officers; regulations.\n   20  1.  Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of law, all violations of\n   21  this chapter or of a law, ordinance, order, rule or regulation  relating\n   22  to  traffic,  except parking, standing, stopping or pedestrian offenses,\n   23  which occur within a city having a population of two hundred thousand or\n   24  more in which administrative tribunals have heretofore been established,\n   25  or within that portion of Suffolk county for which a district court  has\n   26  been  established,  and which are classified as traffic infractions, may\n   27  be heard and determined pursuant to the regulations of the  [commission-\n   28  er]  DIRECTOR  OF  THE  TRAFFIC  VIOLATIONS BUREAU as provided in [this]\n   29  article THREE-B OF THIS TITLE.  Whenever a crime and a  traffic  infrac-\n   30  tion  arise out of the same transaction or occurrence, a charge alleging\n   31  both offenses may be made returnable before the court  having  jurisdic-\n   32  tion  over  the  crime.  Nothing  herein  provided shall be construed to\n   33  prevent a court, having jurisdiction over a criminal charge relating  to\n   34  traffic  or  a  traffic infraction, from lawfully entering a judgment of\n   35  conviction, whether or not based on a plea of guilty,  for  any  offense\n   36  classified as a traffic infraction.\n   37    2.

Prior notice of such request need not be given the\n   43  motorist involved. Upon receipt of such request, the court may grant  an\n   44  order transferring such case, provided that the date on which the charge\n   45  or  charges  must be answered before the court shall not be earlier than\n   46  the return date which appears on the  complaint  alleging  the  offense.\n   47  Notice  of  transfer  of  cases involving other than traffic infractions\n   48  shall be mailed to  the  motorist  at  the  address  appearing  on  such\n   49  complaint not less than ten days before the date of appearance indicated\n   50  on  his  OR HER summons and not less than fifteen days before his OR HER\n   51  scheduled appearance in such court.

Such mailing shall constitute due notice of such\n\n       A. 1179                             4\n\n    1  transfer.  Thereafter, such case shall be treated in the same manner  as\n    2  if the complaint had initially been filed with such court.\n    3    3.  The  commissioner [shall appoint such hearing officers as shall be\n    4  necessary to hear and determine cases as provided by this  article  and]\n    5  may promulgate [such] regulations [as shall be necessary or desirable to\n    6  effect  the  purposes  of this article. Such regulations may] TO provide\n    7  for a schedule of monetary penalties to be used where an answer is made,\n    8  other than before a hearing officer, admitting a charge,  provided  that\n    9  no such penalty shall exceed the maximum fine established by law for the\n   10  traffic infraction involved.\n   11    S 3. Codification of changes. Within nine months of the effective date\n   12  of  this  section,  the commissioner of motor vehicles shall prepare and\n   13  submit to the governor, the temporary president and minority  leader  of\n   14  the  senate,  and  the  speaker  and  minority  leader of the assembly a\n   15  proposed codification of changes in law  necessary  and  appropriate  to\n   16  carry  out the purposes and provisions of article 3-B of the vehicle and\n   17  traffic law as added by section one of  this  act.  Such  changes  shall\n   18  include  provisions for transition of personnel and cases to the traffic\n   19  violations bureau.\n   20    S 4. This act shall take effect on the first of January next  succeed-\n   21  ing  the  date  on which it shall have become a law; except that section\n   22  three of this act shall take effect immediately.\n",
