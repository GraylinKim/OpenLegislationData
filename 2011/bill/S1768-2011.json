Statement of legislative intent. Small manufacturing enter-\n    2  prises are responsible for an estimated twenty-eight to forty percent of\n    3  employment  in  the manufacturing sector. They tend to be more effective\n    4  at job creation and job replacement, more innovative in the  development\n    5  of  products  and  process  improvements,  more  flexible, and thus more\n    6  competitive, in terms of the ability to produce small quantities. All of\n    7  these factors help to explain the shift to  smaller  and  average  sized\n    8  plants  and  the  national  trend toward more of the total production of\n    9  goods coming from small manufacturers.\n   10    Small manufacturing enterprises, often owned  by  minorities  and  new\n   11  immigrants,  have  been  growing. Leading this expansion in New York are\n   12  specialty and ethnic food manufacturers, which have grown by  more  than\n   13  eight  percent over the past year. Other evidence suggests that there is\n   14  similar growth in construction; specialty apparel for niche markets  and\n   15  other  design-based  manufacturing  industries  such  as luxury consumer\n   16  goods like jewelry; medical instruments;  suppliers  to  service  indus-\n   17  tries;  and  companies  serving  local  markets,  such as makers of food\n   18  products or suppliers of construction materials.\n   19    Often, small manufacturers can not only survive, but grow, if they can\n   20  identify and develop niche markets - targeted markets composed of  indi-\n   21  viduals  and businesses that have similar interests and needs, which can\n   22  be readily identified, and that can be easily targeted and reached, or a\n   23  group of potential customers who  share  common  characteristics  making\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD06744-01-1\n\n       S. 1768                             2\n\n    1  them especially receptive to the company's product, service, or opportu-\n    2  nity.\n    3    S  2.

  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1768\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the New York state urban development corporation act, in\nrelation to creating niche market assistance projects to promote\neconomic development\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nTo assist small manufacturers to seek niche markets.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nA \"niche market\" is a targeted market composed of individuals and\nbusinesses that have similar interests and needs, which can be\nreadily identified and that can be easily targeted and reached, or\ngroup of potential customers who share common characteristics making\nthem especially receptive to the company's product, service or\nopportunity.\n\nThe bill establishes a competitive program in UDC providing grants of\nup to $200,000 to a not-for-profit corporation or Manufacturing\nExtension partnership program with a demonstrated capacity to conduct\nmarket analysis and seek new markets for niche products for\nmanufacturers, to enable the grant recipients to work with and assist\nsmall manufacturers identify and develop niche markets.\n\nEntities eligible to apply for funding for a niche market assistance\nproject include not-for-profit corporations, local development\ncorporations, trade associations, educational institutions,\ntechnology development corporations which operate manufacturing\nextension programs, and other not-for-profit organizations which\npromote economic development.\n\nProjects eligible to be a niche market assistance include research,\nmarket analysis, marketing assistance, and identifying sources of\nfinancial assistance to enter into new markets.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nSmall manufacturing enterprises are responsible for an estimated\n28%-40% of employment in the manufacturing sector. They tend to be\nmore effective at job creation and job replacement, more innovative\nin the development of products and process improvements, more\nflexible and thus more competitive, in terms of the ability to\nproduce small quantities. All of these factors help to explain the\nshift to a smaller average plant size and the national trend toward\nmore of the total production of goods coming from smaller\nmanufacturers.\n\nSmall manufacturing enterprises, often owned by, minorities and\nimmigrants, have been growing. Leading this expansion in New York are\nspecialty and ethnic food manufacturers, which have grown by more\nthan 8 percent over the past year. other evidence suggests that there\nis similar growth in construction; specialty apparel for niche\nmarkets and other design-based manufacturing industries such as\nluxury consumer goods like jewelry; medical instruments; suppliers to\n\n\nservice industries; end companies serving local markets, such as\nmakers of food products or suppliers of construction materials.\n\nOften, small manufacturers can not only survive, but grow, if they can\nidentify and develop niche markets - targeted markets composed of\nindividuals and businesses that have similar interests and needs,\nwhich can be readily identified, and that can be easily targeted and\nreached, or group of potential customers who share common\ncharacteristics making them especially receptive to the company's\nproduct, services, or opportunity.\n\nSmall firms are traditionally hard to reach by centralized state\nprograms. Therefore this program reaches out to local and regional\npartners who are familiar with and have established relationships\nwith businesses in their areas.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-2010: Referred to Corporations, Authorities and Commissions\nReported and Committed to Finance\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nUndetermined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediate.\n\n",
