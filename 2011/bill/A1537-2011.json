Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  that\n    2  certified  registered nurse anesthetists are highly educated and trained\n    3  advanced practice nurses who hold a national professional certification,\n    4  and whose competency in the professional practice of nurse anesthesia in\n    5  hospitals, free-standing ambulatory surgery  centers,  clinics,  profes-\n    6  sional  offices  and  other facilities is well known. Nurse anesthetists\n    7  are integral to the continued professional delivery of services in  such\n    8  health care facilities throughout the state.\n    9    The  legislature  further  finds  that  statutory recognition of nurse\n   10  anesthetists will further enhance  patient  safety  by  codifying  their\n   11  professional  scope of practice that is currently governed in this state\n   12  by regulations promulgated pursuant to the public health law in the case\n   13  of hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers.\n   14    The legislature also finds that while nurse anesthetists are  advanced\n   15  practice  nurses, licensed as registered professional nurses under arti-\n   16  cle 139 of the education law, no provision  of  this  act  is  meant  to\n   17  limit,  diminish  or in any way impinge upon the practice of the profes-\n   18  sion of nursing as a registered professional nurse under such article.\n   19    Therefore, the legislature hereby declares that, due to the  intrinsic\n   20  nature  of  the administration of anesthesia services, the integral part\n   21  that certified registered nurse anesthetists play in the  safe  delivery\n   22  of  such  services and the need to protect and enhance patient safety in\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD05347-01-1\n\n       A. 1537                             2\n\n    1  all health care facilities, it is in the interest of the people of  this\n    2  state to recognize the national professional certification of registered\n    3  nurse  anesthetists  and  that  the  existing scope of practice of nurse\n    4  anesthesia,  as  currently practiced in this state, be codified in stat-\n    5  ute.\n    6    S 2.
