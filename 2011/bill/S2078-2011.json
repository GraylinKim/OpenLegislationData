  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2078\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to personalized gun safety\n\nPURPOSE OF THE BILL:\nTo reduce the incidence of\ndeaths and injuries\nattributable to guns through design changes by creating a\npersonalized gun standard. Personalized firearms can also reduce the\nflow of stolen guns which are frequently used to commit crimes.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThe bill amends the penal law by adding a new article 401\n\"Personalized Gun Safety Act.\" A temporary firearm safety\nstandard commission,\nconsisting of nine members including the superintendent of state\npolice, the commissioner of the division of criminal justice services\nand the commissioner of health, is created for the purpose of\nestablishing a personalized safety performance standard for firearms.\nSuch standard will require that all firearms manufactured, assembled,\naltered, offered for sale, sold, traded, transferred, shipped,\nleased, distributed, acquired or possessed within the state shall be\n\"personalized\" so that only authorized users can operate them.\nThe commission shall formulate the necessary testing procedure to\ndetermine if a firearm complies with the standard and shall designate\none or more independent laboratories for determining whether firearms\ncomply with the standard. The manufacturer of a firearm must submit a\nprototype of the firearm model for testing to one of the independent\nlaboratories designated by the commission. If the firearm model fails\nto meet the safety standard, the firearm cannot be manufactured or\noffered for sale until the firearm has been modified to meet the\nstandard and has passed the test on resubmission. If the firearm\nmeets the standard, the Superintendent of state police shall issue a\ncertificate stating that the firearm model meets the standard. The\ncertified label shall be imprinted on the approved firearm.\n\nManufacturers and others are required to comply with the standard four\nyears from the date on which the commission's original standard is\nadopted. This time period acknowledges the gun manufacturers' need\nfor time to research the technology and to retool. Antique firearms\nare exempt from the requirements because they are typically purchased\nand kept as collector's items and not for use. Firearms manufactured\nprior to the compliance date are also exempt. However, dealers are\nprohibited from selling or otherwise transferring those guns.\n\nThis prohibition is intended to prevent dealers and others from\nstockpiling guns that do not comply with the safety standard. Law\nenforcement and military personnel are also exempt from the\nrequirements of the law.\n\nIn addition to the standard penalties against those who manufacture,\ntransport or ship firearms that do not meet the safety standard and\nagainst those who deface or alter the personalized characteristics of\na firearm, the bill enables individuals who are injured or the\nrepresentative of those killed by the discharge of firearms not\nmeeting the standard to bring an action against the person who fires\nthe weapon and the owner. The bill does recognize the defense that\nthe firearm was being used by a law enforcement officer in the line\nof duty or for self protection.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThere are approximately 40,000 gun\ndeaths in the United\nStates annually. Some 1,400 youngsters commit suicide with guns\nannually. In 1994, according to the NYS Department of Health, there\nwere over 700 cases of hospitalization and over 300 deaths involving\nchildren due to firearms. In 1994, there were nearly 4,000\nhospitalizations due to firearm injuries and more than 2,000 deaths\nas a result of firearm injuries. Deaths and injuries from firearms\nare a major public health problem. Various strategies to reduce the\nnumber of these tragedies have been proposed. These approaches\nprimarily focus on the behavior of the individual, as opposed to the\ndesign of the firearm itself. Injury prevention professionals tend to\nadvocate for the modification of the design of products rather than\nbehavior modification as an effective way to prevent injury and\ndeath. Thus, many products including drug packages, cigarette\nlighters and motor vehicles have been modified to make them safer.\n\nChanging the design of firearms so that they are personalized can also\nreduce the likelihood of certain gun-related deaths and injuries.\nPersonalized or \"smart\" guns, which can only be fired by the\nauthorized user, would be inoperable by the young child, the\ndepressed contemplating suicide, and the criminal who steals a firearm.\n\nWhile many young children are victims of unintentional shootings,\nteenagers are at even greater risk of dying from an unintentional\ngunshot wound. However, should a youngster find a personalized\nfirearm, it would be inoperable regardless of the child's behavior\nthereby preventing many deaths and injuries.\n\nStudies have shown that 40 percent to 70 percent of the guns used by\nfelons are stolen, most from private homes. Since thefts, which total\nsome half-million guns a year, are a significant source of guns used\nin crime, requiring all guns to be personalized could limit the\navailability of firearms to adults and juveniles in the illegal or\nsecondary gun market.\n\nA variety of technologically feasible designs can be incorporated into\na firearm to personalize it. Magnetic devices, radio frequency\ntransponders, and/or combination locks are just some of the designs\nwhich will prevent an unauthorized user from firing the weapon.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nFirst day of November.\n\n",
