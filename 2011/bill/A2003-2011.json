Notwith-\n   11  standing the fact that adoption records shall be sealed and secret, they\n   12  may be microfilmed and processed pursuant to  an  order  of  the  court,\n   13  provided  that  such  order  provides  that  the confidentiality of such\n   14  records be maintained. If the confidentiality is violated, the person or\n   15  company violating it can be found guilty of contempt of court.

Before  the  record  is\n   24  sealed,  such  order may be granted upon written ex parte application on\n   25  good cause shown and upon such conditions as the court may impose. After\n   26  the record is sealed, such order may be  granted  only  upon  notice  as\n   27  hereinafter provided for disclosure or access and inspection of records.\n   28  The  clerk  upon  request  of  a person or agency entitled thereto shall\n   29  issue certificates of adoption which shall contain only the new name  of\n   30  the  child and the date and place of birth of the child, the name of the\n   31  adoptive parents and the date when and  court  where  the  adoption  was\n   32  granted,  which  certificate  as to the facts recited therein shall have\n   33  the same force and effect as a certified copy of an order of adoption.\n   34    S 9.
