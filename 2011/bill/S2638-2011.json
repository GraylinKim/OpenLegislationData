  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2638\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the tax law, in relation to requiring a\nrevenue distribution agreement\nfor equitable allocation within the county of Suffolk for public safety\npurposes of sales and compensating use tax\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nThis bill would allow the County of Suffolk to allocate a portion of\nthe net collection of sales and compensating use taxes for equitable\ndistribution county-wide for purposes of public safety and property\ntax stabilization and relief.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nAmends Subdivision c of Section 1262-j of the Tax Law, as amended by\nChapter 684 of the Laws of 2007. This bill would require Suffolk\nCounty to deposit any monies from the one percent tax increase to be\ndeposited into a special and separate fund, codified in the County\nCharter. If any monies are allocated from such special fund for\nproperty tax stabilization and relief to the Suffolk County Police\nDistrict, then the county shall allocate monies to the towns and\nvillages which are not part of the Suffolk County Police District in\norder to ensure equitable distribution county-wide.\n\nThe allocations from the special fund created pursuant to this section\nshall be subject to a revenue distribution agreement. The revenue\ndistribution agreement shall be codified in the county charter and\nremain in effect as long as such sales and compensating use tax\ncomponent is in effect, or any successor component, for such public\nsafety purposes.\n\nOne of two methods for determining the reduction of Suffolk County\npolice district taxes to the towns and villages which are not part of\nthe Suffolk County police district shall be used: (1) the basis of\nthe respective populations of the several towns and villages in\nSuffolk County, determined in accordance with the latest federal\ncensus or special population census taken\npursuant to section twenty of the general municipal law, completed and\npublished prior to the end of the quarter for which the allocation is\nmade, which special population must include the entire area of the\ncounty; or (2) the basis of the nineteen hundred ninety-four amounts\nallocated and uniformly increasing in proportionality across Suffolk\nCounty and taking into account any successor component for the sales\nand compensating use tax, notwithstanding any year of inequitable\ndistribution by the county of Suffolk to towns and villages outside\nof the Suffolk county police district.\n\nIf the County allocates monies from such special fund directly to the\ngeneral fund to reduce the tax levy for county-wide public safety\npurposes, the corresponding property tax relief is provided on a\ncounty-wide basis and on the basis of full valuation of real property\nand no further revenue distribution agreement is required.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nUnder current New York State Law, no less than one-eighth and no more\nthan three-eighths of the net collections received by Suffolk County\nas a result of the one per cent tax increase shall be dedicated for\npublic safety purposes; the balance to be deposited in the Suffolk\nCounty General Fund.\n\nThis legislation is intended to create a equitable distribution of the\nfunds rather than permitting Suffolk County to impose the tax on all\ncounty residents, and providing disproportionate shares to any\nspecial assessment district.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n2009-10: S.2272/A.4789\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nNone to the State.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis act shall take effect immediately with allocation and\ndistributions of new collections to be proposed within the 2011\nbudget of the County of Suffolk.\n\n",
