Issues, discussions and outcomes will not be divulged\nexcept in cases which may be illegal or life threatening. A pair of\ntrained volunteer student mediators will meet with the two parties to\nhelp them reach an agreement.\n\nPeace/Conflict resolution centers already in operation at Luperon and\nHeritage High schools in Washington Heights have demonstrated that\nmediation of disputes can reduce violence in schools, reduce the\nnumber of suspensions, and promote constructive conflict management.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nNew Bill.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
