  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2537\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the environmental conservation law, in relation to fishing\nlicense fees in the county of Onondaga\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nThis bill will dedicate twenty percent of money collected from fishing\nlicenses sold in Onondaga County to offset costs of the Carpenter's\nBrook fish hatchery.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection one amends subdivision 4 of section 11-0702 of the\nenvironmental conservation law that relates to moneys collected from\nfishing licenses and deposited in the state fish and game trust\naccount by allowing twenty percent of such monies to be used to\noffset costs of Carpenter's Brook fish hatchery.\n\nSection two amends subdivision 6 of section 11-0715 of the\nenvironmental conservation law by adding a new paragraph allowing\ntwenty percent of the proceeds coming from the sale of fishing\nlicenses paid by Onondaga county residents to be retained by\nCarpenter's Brook fish hatchery.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nSince 1983, Onondaga County has operated Carpenter's\nBrook Fish Hatchery based solely on local tax dollars. During its 72\nyear existence, the hatchery has stocked more than 5 million yearling\nand two-year old Brook, Brown and Rainbow trout in local waterways\nthroughout the country.\nThe New York State Department of Environmental Conservation provides\nassistance to Carpenter's Brook in the form of fingerling trout and\ntesting for fish health certification but does not stock any local\nstreams, rivers, or ponds in Onondaga County on an annual\nbasis-despite collecting more than $750,000 annually in license fees.\nOnondaga County and the Onondaga County Federation of Sportsman Club\nis requesting this legislation to offset a significant portion of the\noperational costs for Carpenter's Brook Fish Hatchery.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-2010: S.7527\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
