  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2409\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the agriculture and markets law, in relation to training,\nexamination\nand\ncertification of dog control officers\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nThe purpose of this legislation is to\ndevelop a training, examination and certification program for dog\ncontrol officers, police officers; and peace officers who deal with\nanimal control or animal abuse issues.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThe agriculture and markets law is\namended by adding a new section 114-a. Training and certification of\ndog control officers. The department, in consultation with the\ndepartment of education, shall develop a training, examination and\ncertification program for dog control officers, police officers and\npeace officers who deal with animal control or animal abuse issues.\n2. (a) Any person appointed as a dog control officer shall, before\nappointment or within one year thereafter, complete a training course\napproved by the department and shall take and pass an examination\ngiven by the department. 3. Training program required by this section\nshall include training regarding: (a) the role of the investigator in\ncases involving animals or animal abuse; (b) appropriate and humane\nhandling of animals and general animal control; (c) evaluation of\nanimal cruelty and abuse, (d) evaluation of facilities where animals\nare kept, (e) evidentiary issues including collection of evidence;\n(f) laws and rules regarding search and seizure; (g) community\npolicing and interaction; (h) crisis and intervention safety (i)\nstrategies to ensure that abused animals are permanently separated\nfrom their abusers; (j) identification of\nresources to house animals while a criminal case is resolved; (k)\nreport writing and courtroom testimony; (1) disposal of the remains\nof deceased animals; and (n) identification and notification of an\nanimal's owner. 4. The governing body of a political subdivision that\nappoints a dog control officer who fails to obtain certification\nwithin the required time shall terminate the appointment. 5. The\ndepartment shall (a) determine the format of the training and\ncertification exams, including an internet based format if the\ndepartment deems such to be appropriate.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThis legislation was proposed following an incident of\naggravated animal cruelty involving an untrained part time animal\ncontrol officer working in Lackawanna, NY. The officer shot and\nkilled one cat and two kittens in the basement of an apartment\ncomplex after being called to retrieve the animals. The highly\n\npublicized incident brought to light the lack of qualifications and\nany training of many appointed animal control officers throughout the\nstate. These untrained officers often do not make the proper animal\ncontrol decisions when confronted with a call. This bill establishes\na mandatory training requirement for all dog control officers and the\ntaking and passing of an examination of all dog control officers by\nJuly 15, of 2013. Any person employed as a dog control officer shall\ncomplete the training.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nPassed Assembly in 2009.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to the state. New fees will be established\nto offset the cost of any training and certification.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect July 1, 2013, provided\nthat, effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or repeal\nof any rule or regulation necessary for the implementation of this\nact on its effective date are authorized and directed to be made and\ncompleted on or before such effective date.\n\n",
