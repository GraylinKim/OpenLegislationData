  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1257\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the labor law, in relation to developing and implementing\nprograms to prevent workplace violence in public schools\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill amends section 27-b of the Labor Law to include public\nschools within the provisions of current law designed to require\npublic employers to develop and implement programs to prevent\nworkplace violence.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nAn amendment is made within section 27-b of the Labor law.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nIn 2006, public schools were excluded as an 'employer' based on an\nestablished amendment within the Labor law. Since public schools are\nexcluded as an employer, they do not have to develop and implement\nworkplace violence protection programs.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nWorkplace violence is an increasingly visible element in today's\nworkplaces. This bill would assist both employers and employees in\nensuring a safe work environment.\n\nWorkplace violence is now one of the leading causes of death on the\njob in the United States and the leading cause of workplace\nfatalities for women. Enactment of this bill would require school\ndistricts, with at least 20 full-time permanent employees, to develop\nand implement programs to prevent workplace violence, must evaluate\nthe potential risks of workplace violence that exist within their\nworkplaces, and then develop and implement a written workplace\nviolence prevention program to prevent and minimize the hazard of\nworkplace violence to their employees.\n\nViolence is a substantial contributor to occupational injury and\ndeath, and homicide has become the second leading cause of\noccupational injury death. Each week, an average of 20 workers are\nmurdered and 18,000 are assaulted while at work or on duty. Nonfatal\nassaults result in millions of lost workdays and cost workers\nmillions of dollars in lost wages.\n\nworkplace violence is clustered in certain occupational settings, For\nexample, the retail trade and service industries account for more\nthan half of workplace homicides and 85% of nonfatal workplace\nassaults.\n\nTaxicab drivers have the highest risk of workplace homicides of any\noccupational group. Workers in health care, community services, and\n\nretail settings are at increased risk of nonfatal assaults. Risk\nfactors for workplace violence include dealing with the public, the\nexchange of money, and the delivery of services or goods, prevention\nstrategies for minimizing the risk of workplace violence include (but\nare not limited to) cash-handling policies, physical separation of\nworkers from customers, good lighting, security devices, escort\nservices, and employee training.\n\nA workplace violence prevention program should include a system for\ndocumenting incidents, procedures to be taken in the event of\nincidents, and open communication between employers and workers.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-2010: S.2124 Passed Labor committee; Committed to Finance\n2008-2009: S.2124 - Passed Labor Committee; Committed to Finance\n2007-2008: S.6007 - Committed to Rules\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nFiscal implications of $287,000 for the Department of Labor and the\nhiring of three new inspectors.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the one hundred twentieth day after it\nshall have become a law, provided, however that the adoption or\namendment of any rules or regulations necessary for the timely\nimplementation of this act are authorized to be made immediately.\n\n",
