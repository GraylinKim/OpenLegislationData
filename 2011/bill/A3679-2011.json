Subdivision 3 of section 749 of the real property actions\n    2  and proceedings law, as amended by chapter 192 of the laws of  1975,  is\n    3  amended to read as follows:\n    4    3.    The [issuing] EXECUTION of a warrant for the removal of a tenant\n    5  cancels the agreement under which the person removed held the  premises,\n    6  and  annuls  the relation of landlord and tenant[, but nothing contained\n    7  herein shall deprive the court of the power to vacate such  warrant  for\n    8  good cause shown prior to the execution thereof].

Petitioner may recover by action any sum of money  which  was\n   11  payable  at  the  time when the special proceeding was commenced and the\n   12  reasonable value of the use and occupation to the time when the  warrant\n   13  was  [issued] EXECUTED, for any period of time with respect to which the\n   14  agreement does not make any provision for payment of rent.\n   15    S 2.
