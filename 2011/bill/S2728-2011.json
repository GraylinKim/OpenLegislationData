  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2728\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the tax law, in relation to qualified transportation fringe\nbenefits\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo make permanent the New York State pretax deduction benefit\nof up to $230 a month for commuting expenses.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1. Amends subsection (c) of section 612\nof the tax law by adding a new paragraph 39 to make permanent the New\nYork State pretax deduction benefit of up to $230 a month for\ncommuting expenses for employees and individuals who are self-employed.\n\nSection 2. Effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nCurrently New York State's tax code chooses to mirror\nthe federal governments internal revenue code and allows for a\nmonthly pretax deduction of up to $230 for commuting expenses.\nAlthough in 2010 this benefit was extended at the eleventh hour by\nCongress. This legislation is necessary in order to protect commuters\nfrom losing this benefit for New York State income tax.\n\nThis deduction gives employers the option of allowing their employees\nto set aside up to $230 a month of their salaries before taxes to pay\nfor transit and vanpool fares, up to $230 per month for qualified\nparking expenses at or near an employer's workplace from which the\nemployee commutes via transit or vanpool.\n\nThis bill allows New York State taxpayers to continue to receive this\nbenefit even if the federal benefit is reduced or eliminated.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nNew Bill.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone, currently this benefit is offered under the\nNew York State Tax Code, this legislation would make this\nexisting benefit permanent at existing levels.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
