PERKINS, BRESLIN, DIAZ, DILAN, DUANE, HASSELL-THOMP-\n         SON,  KRUEGER, KRUGER, MONTGOMERY, OPPENHEIMER, PARKER, SERRANO, SMITH\n         -- read twice and ordered printed, and when printed to be committed to\n         the Committee on Civil Service and Pensions\n\n       AN ACT to amend the retirement and social security law, in  relation  to\n         prohibiting  investment  of  certain  public  funds in companies doing\n         business in Sudan\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. The retirement and social security law is amended by adding\n    2  a new section 423-d to read as follows:\n    3    S  423-D.  INVESTMENT OF CERTAIN PUBLIC FUNDS IN COMPANIES DOING BUSI-\n    4  NESS IN SUDAN. 1. ON AND AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF  THIS  SECTION,  NO\n    5  MONEYS  OR ASSETS OF THE COMMON RETIREMENT FUND SHALL BE INVESTED IN THE\n    6  STOCKS, SECURITIES OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS OF ANY  INSTITUTION  OR  COMPANY\n    7  DOING  BUSINESS  IN  OR WITH SUDAN OR WITH AGENCIES OR INSTRUMENTALITIES\n    8  THEREOF. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF LAW TO THE CONTRARY, NO ASSETS\n    9  OF ANY PENSION OR ANNUITY FUND  UNDER  THE  JURISDICTION  OF  THE  COMP-\n   10  TROLLER,  SHALL  BE  INVESTED IN ANY BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WHICH\n   11  DIRECTLY OR THROUGH A SUBSIDIARY HAS OUTSTANDING LOANS TO  OR  FINANCIAL\n   12  ACTIVITIES IN SUDAN OR ITS INSTRUMENTALITIES AND NO SUCH ASSETS SHALL BE\n   13  INVESTED  IN  THE STOCKS, SECURITIES OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS OF ANY COMPANY\n   14  WHICH DIRECTLY OR THROUGH A SUBSIDIARY IS ENGAGED IN BUSINESS IN OR WITH\n   15  SUDAN OR ITS INSTRUMENTALITIES.\n   16    2. THE COMPTROLLER SHALL TAKE  APPROPRIATE  ACTION  TO  SELL,  REDEEM,\n   17  DIVEST OR WITHDRAW ANY INVESTMENT HELD IN VIOLATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF\n   18  THIS  SECTION. THIS SECTION SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED TO REQUIRE THE PREMA-\n   19  TURE OR OTHERWISE IMPRUDENT SALE, REDEMPTION, DIVESTMENT  OR  WITHDRAWAL\n   20  OF  AN  INVESTMENT,  BUT SUCH SALE, REDEMPTION, DIVESTMENT OR WITHDRAWAL\n   21  SHALL BE COMPLETED NOT LATER THAN THREE YEARS  FOLLOWING  THE  EFFECTIVE\n   22  DATE OF THIS SECTION.\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD06893-02-1\n\n       S. 2477                             2\n\n    1    3.  WITHIN  SIXTY  DAYS  AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, THE\n    2  COMPTROLLER SHALL FILE WITH THE LEGISLATURE A REPORT OF ALL  INVESTMENTS\n    3  HELD  AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION WHICH ARE IN VIOLATION OF\n    4  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION. EVERY YEAR THEREAFTER,  THE  COMPTROLLER\n    5  SHALL REPORT ON ALL INVESTMENTS SOLD, REDEEMED, DIVESTED OR WITHDRAWN IN\n    6  COMPLIANCE  WITH  THIS  SECTION.    EACH REPORT AFTER THE INITIAL REPORT\n    7  SHALL PROVIDE A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRESS WHICH  THE  COMPTROLLER  HAS\n    8  MADE  SINCE  THE  PREVIOUS  REPORT  AND SINCE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS\n    9  SECTION.\n   10    S 2. This act shall take effect immediately.\n         FISCAL NOTE.-- This bill would require that any assets of  the  Common\n       Retirement  Fund Invested in any company doing business in or with Sudan\n       or with agencies or instrumentalities be divested not later  than  three\n       years following the date of enactment of this legislation.\n         If  this  bill  is enacted, it would decrease the number of investment\n       choices available for investment by the Common Retirement Fund.  Presum-\n       ably this could lead to a lower rate of return  on  the  Fund's  invest-\n       ments,  decreasing  the  probability  of achieving our actuarial assumed\n       rate of return, currently at 7.5%. A diminished  rate  of  return  would\n       cause  an increase in the contributions of the State of New York and the\n       participating employers in the  New  York  State  and  Local  Employees'\n       Retirement  System  and  the  New  York  State and Local Police and Fire\n       Retirement System. There also would be additional  administrative  costs\n       to identify companies that are doing business in or with Sudan.\n         This  estimate,  dated  January  21,  2011,  and intended for use only\n       during the  2011  Legislative  Session,  is  Fiscal  Note  No.  2011-96,\n       prepared  by  the  Actuary  for  the New York State and Local Employees\n       Retirement System and the New York  State  and  Local  Police  and  Fire\n       Retirement System.\n",
