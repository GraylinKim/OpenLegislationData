  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1747\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to burglary in the second degree\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo include display of a device or object\nwhich appears to be\na bomb, destructive device, explosive or hazardous substance within\nthe definition of burglary in the 2nd degree.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection one amends &sect;140.25 to include display of a device which\nappears to be a bomb, destructive device, explosive or hazardous\nsubstance in the definition of burglary in the second degree.\n\nSection 2 establishes the effective date.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nUnder current law, burglary in the\nthird degree can be\nelevated to the second degree when a person displays a fake gun in\nthe course of, or immediate flight from, the crime. However, this is\nnot the case if a person displays what appears to be a bomb.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe crime of burglary in the third degree is elevated to the second\ndegree when the crime is committed under certain exacerbating\nconditions, such as when the assailant is armed with explosives or a\ndeadly weapon. New York has recognized that brandishing what appears\nto be a gun in the course of a burglary elevates the severity of the\ncrime, and therefore this-action is included in the 2nd degree of\nburglary. The same is not true, however, when the assailant displays\nwhat appears to be a bomb or other hazardous device or substance.\nThis creates a situation in which an assailant can be charged with a\nlesser crime if he uses a fake bomb to threaten his victims instead of\na fake gun. Such a result is especially absurd in light of the fact\nthat the statute places display of an actual gun and an actual bomb\nor other hazardous device on the same level. This legislation would\ncorrect that anomaly and make the statute more logically consistent.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2007-2008: S.3765 - Referred to Codes, Passed Senate\n2009-2010: S.2102 - Referred to Codes\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n120 days after enactment.\n\n",
