  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1984\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public service law, in relation to the appointment of\nmembers of the public service commission\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nIn its January 2007 report, the\nAssembly Queens Power Outage Task Force recommended several measures\nto improve oversight of utilities and prevent future blackouts. This\nbill borrows from the experience of several other states to set\nclearly defined statutory qualifications for prospective members of\nthe Public Service Commission (PSC), and sets forth a deliberative\nprocess for ensuring that any new appointees are widely acknowledged\nas highly qualified.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nBill &sect;1 amends &sect;4 of the Public Service Law by\nadding a new subdivision 4, providing that, to ensure the highest\nstandard of public utility regulation, any person appointed as a\nmember of the Public Service Commission (PSC) shall be qualified for\nsuch appointment as provided in &sect;4-a of such law. Bill &sect;2 adds &sect;4-a,\nwhich in summary provides:\n\n* any person appointed as a PSC commissioner shall (a) have education\nand training and 3 or more years of experience in one or more of the\nfollowing fields: economics, engineering, law, accounting, business\nmanagement, utility regulation, public policy, consumer advocacy or\nenvironmental management; and (b) shall be selected from a list of\nindividuals nominated by a new Public Service Commission Nominating\nBoard (PSCNB);\n\n* the PSCNB consists of the following individuals: (1) the Executive\nDirector of the Consumer Protection Board (or designee);\n\n(2) the President of NYSERDA (or designee);\n\n(3) the Commissioner of Economic Development (or designee);\n\n(4) the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation (or designee);\n\n(5) the Attorney General (or designee);\n\n(6) a professional engineer appointed by the Commissioner of Education;\n\n(7) a certified public accountant appointed by the Commissioner of\nEducation;\n\n(8) a person 65 years of age of older appointed by the Director of the\nstate Office for the Aging;\n\n(9) a representative of business entities regulated by the PSC,\nappointed by the Governor;\n\n(10) a representative of business entities that are not regulated by\nthe PSC, appointed by the governor;\n\n(11) a representative of labor appointed by the governor;\n\n(12) two members of the public appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly;\n\n(13) two members of the public appointed by the Temporary President of\nthe Senate;\n\n(14) a member of the public appointed by the Assembly Minority; and\n\n(15) a member of the public appointed by the Senate Minority Leader.\n\n* The PSCNB shall select a chairperson, adopt bylaws, and keep a\nrecord of its proceedings. Special meetings may be called by the\nchairperson, and shall be called by the chairperson upon receipt of a\nwritten request for a meeting signed by two or more members of the\nboard.\n\n* The PSCNB shall review and evaluate possible appointees for the\noffice of commissioner of the PSC, and, within 2-3 months prior to\nthe expiration of a PSC commissioner's term or within one month after\nthe death, resignation or termination of service of such a member,\nshall provide the Governor with a list of 4 individuals who the PSCNB\nadjudges to be the most fully qualified to serve on the commission.\nThe board shall not include the name of an individual upon the list\nif his or her appointment would result in a greater number of members\nof the PSC belonging to the same political party than is permitted\npursuant to section four of this chapter.\n\n* Within 30 days of receipt of the PSCNB's recommendations, the\nGovernor shall fill the vacancy by appointment of one of the persons\nrecommended by the board, or may reject all nominees of the board and\nreconvene the PSCNB in order to select 4 additional nominees.\nHowever, once the Governor has done so and the PSCNB has provided a\nsecond list of 4 names, the Governor shall make the appointment from\none of the names on the first list or the second list.\n\nEFFECTS OF PRESENT LAW WHICH THIS BILL WOULD ALTER:\nThere are\ncurrently no statutory standards for appointment to the PSC, other\nthan provisions for political party balance, and no process for\nselection of the most qualified individuals.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nLast summer, the western part of Queens suffered a\nmassive power outage that lasted 9 days. The Assembly Queens Power\nOutage Task Force studied the outage's causes and the inadequate\n\nresponses by the company responsible for the transmission and\ndistribution system, Consolidated Edison, and by the Public Service\nCommission.\nOne underlying cause of this debacle was found to be the reliance by\nNew York's utility regulators on antiquated laws, regulations and\npolicies\nthat let companies engaged in energy transmission and\ndistribution operate without effective oversight.\n\nThe Task Force found that, unlike many other states, New York does not\nhave any substantive statutory standards for who may serve on the PSC.\nThis bill sets forth such standards, as well as a process similar to\nthose utilized in Ohio and Florida to seek out the most qualified\nindividuals to assist the state in this vital area of regulation.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nNone.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThe 120th day after enactment.\n\n",
