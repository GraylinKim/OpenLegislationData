  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1937\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the education law,\nin relation to hazing, serving alcohol to minors and illegal drug\noffenses\n\nPURPOSE:\nThe purpose of this hill is to address the issues of underage\ndrinking, hazing and illegal drug use on New York State Campuses.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 of this bill amends section 6430 of the education law amends\nsubdivision 1 and adds a new subdivision 7 expanding rules regarding\nthe prohibition against hazing to include any individual and to\ndefine \"campus organizations or university group\" or for purposes of\nthis article.\n\nSection 2 of this bill amends section 6431 of the Education Law to\ninclude hazing, underage drinking and illegal drug use within the\neducation requirements, and related subdivisions, provided for bias\nrelated crime and sexual assault on campus.\n\nSection 3 of this bill amends the Education Law and adds two new\nsections 6438 and 6439, which deal with hazing, and alcohol abuse and\nillegal drug use. It requires dissemination of information regarding\nthese issues as well as training requirements for appropriate campus\nstaff and other college rules relating thereto. New York State\ncolleges and universities are directed to establish additional policy\nrequirements regarding hazing, underage drinking and drug use on\ncampus and within school clubs, sports teams and social organizations.\n\nSection 4 sets forth the effective date of this legislation.\n\nSection 6439 requires the dissemination of information regarding\nalcohol and drug abuse. It requires the establishment of policies for\ntraining of resident life staff and development of procedures for\nstudents who willfully fail to report abuse.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nNew York State currently has many laws in place to prohibit underage\ndrinking, drug use, and hazing. Under sections 120.16 and 120.17 of\nthe Penal Law, hazing is an illegal activity which currently carries\na penalty of up to one year in prison and/or a fine of up to $1000.\nAdditionally, section 6430 of the Education Law mandates that\ncolleges and universities establish and implement their own policies\nand procedures to deal with hazing. Through a variety of other laws\nincluding the Penal Law, the New York General Obligations Law and the\nNew York Alcohol and Beverage Control Law, underage drinking, serving\n\nalcohol to minors and possession/sale/use of certain drugs are all\nillegal activities.\n\nDespite such laws, underage drinking, hazing and illegal drug\npossession/sale/use are three of the most prominent problems plaguing\nNew York State campuses today. In spite of good faith efforts on the\npart of institutions of higher education to implement policies and\nprocedures to combat these issues, the problems continue and show no\nsigns of decreasing. As a result, parents, administrators and\ntrustees have become increasingly concerned about the safety of their\nchildren and students on campus.\n\nSuch concerns are justified as all too often we are faced with the\nuntimely death or serious injury of our State's young students. Most\nrecently, we suffered the loss of Walter Dean Jennings, a Plattsburgh\nState student who died while pledging a fraternity last March. Under\nthis legislation, those who engage in the dangerous activities of\nhazing and underage drinking would face more serious consequences and\ndisciplinary charges through the college.\n\nWhether it be from dangerous hazing incidents, alcohol poisoning or\ndrug overdoses, something must be done to combat the problems causing\ntragic deaths and injuries on New York State campuses. If\nimplemented, this legislation will bring necessary changes to help\nensure safety on campus and to help deter such harmful behavior in\nthe future.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-10: S.2527\n2003-04: S.6353-A\n2005-06: S.1721-B\n2007-08: S.2600\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the first of July next succeeding the\ndate on which it shall have become law.\n\n",
