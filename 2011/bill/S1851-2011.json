  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1851\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the election law, in relation to the boundaries of election\ndistricts and the designation of polling\nplaces\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill would provide that election districts shall not be drawn in\nsuch a way that they are partly on and partly off a college or\nuniversity campus or other contiguous college or university property\nwith 300 or more registered voters, excluding inactive voters. It\nwould also require that the poll sites for election districts serving\nsuch concentrations of college or university voters shall be on the\ncampus or college or university property, or at a site approved by\nthe college or university.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection one of the bill amends section 4-104 of the election law by\nadding a new subdivision 5-a to provide that whenever 300 or more\nregistered voters (excluding registrants in inactive status) are\nregistered on a contiguous college or university property the polling\nplace for such voters shall be on the property or at a location\napproved by the college or university.\n\nSection two of the bill amends paragraph a of subdivision 3 of section\n4-100 of the election law to add contiguous properties of colleges\nand universities with 300 or more registered voters.\n(excluding registrants in inactive status) to the list of geographic\nareas that cannot be partly In and partly out of an election district.\n\nSection three of the bill sets forth the effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThis bill would provide college and university campuses and other\ncollege and university properties with large concentrations of voters\nwith their own election districts and their own poll sites, in\nrecognition of the fact that requiring residents of colleges and\nuniversities to vote at sites remote from their campuses or requiring\nvoters unaffiliated with the colleges and universities to vote on\ncampuses can present unnecessary obstacles to voting.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010 PASSED SENATE\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nMinimal.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on January 1, 2013.\n\n",
