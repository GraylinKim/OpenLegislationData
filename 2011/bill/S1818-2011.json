  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1818\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the labor law, in relation to asbestos projects\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo exempt municipalities from the payment of asbestos project\nnotification fees when the project is funded by RESTORE monies.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThis bill would amend Labor Law Section 904 subdivision 2 to relieve\ncontractors of municipalities performing asbestos projects which are\nfunded in part by RESTORE monies from paying the project notification\nfee.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nProject notification fees for asbestos were doubled in the recently\nenacted budget. These increased fees adversely impact municipalities\nthat are using RESTORE funding to remove vacant residential buildings.\nThe project notification fees charged to municipalities by contractors\nperforming the removal are paid out of RESTORE monies by the\nmunicipality.\nThis situation effectively results in the state paying itself to the\ndetriment of the RESTORE program. This project notification fee\nlimits the RESTORE monies' value and decreases the number of vacant\nresidences which may be removed.\n\nThis limited exemption from the payment of the asbestos project\nnotification fee would enable municipalities to use RESTORE funding\nfor its intended purpose the removal of vacant buildings, which are\nresulting in blight, drug havens and create hazards for fire and the\nfiremen who respond to such fires.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009 - Died in Labor Committee\n2010 - Died in Labor Committee\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nMinimal.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
