RABBITT -- read once and referred to the Commit-\n         tee on Local Governments\n\n       AN ACT to amend the town law and the local finance law, in  relation  to\n         certain  actions  which  may  not  be  taken without the prior review,\n         approval, permission or consent  of  the  state  comptroller;  and  to\n         repeal  subdivision  13  of  section 54, subdivisions 3, 4, 5 and 6 of\n         section 194, section 209-f and subdivision 13 of section 209-q of  the\n         town law relating thereto\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Legislative findings.    The  legislature  finds  that  the\n    2  provisions  of  article  IX  of the state constitution relating to local\n    3  governments which became effective on January 1, 1964 and the  municipal\n    4  home  rule law enacted by chapter 843 of the laws of 1963 gave a consti-\n    5  tutional grant of home rule powers to local governments. Subdivision (b)\n    6  of section 2 of article IX of the state constitution provides that  \"...\n    7  the legislature:... Shall have the power to act in relation to the prop-\n    8  erty, affairs or government of any local government only by general law,\n    9  or  by  special law\" only in certain circumstances when requested by the\n   10  local legislative body. The legislature does further find  that  certain\n   11  provisions  of  the town law relating to the creation of fire, water and\n   12  sewer districts which were adopted prior to such article IX  are  incon-\n   13  sistent  with  the  constitution and should be repealed. The legislature\n   14  does further find that provisions of the town law requiring the approval\n   15  of the state comptroller prior to the creation of a fire, water or sewer\n   16  district creates an unnecessary burden and \"mandate\" on local government\n   17  that increases the cost of formation of  such  districts,  the  time  to\n   18  create  such districts and is an unwarranted intrusion on the ability of\n   19  local governments to manage their own affairs.\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD01640-01-1\n\n       A. 832                              2\n\n    1    S 2. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 5 of section 54 of the town law,  as\n    2  amended  by  chapter  521  of  the  laws  of 1974, is amended to read as\n    3  follows:\n    4    (a)   At any time prior to the completion of an improvement, the maxi-\n    5  mum amount proposed to be expended for such improvement,  as  stated  in\n    6  the  notice  of  public  hearing  pursuant  to subdivision three or four\n    7  [hereof] OF THIS SECTION, may be increased by an order of the town board\n    8  provided that the town board shall, after a public hearing held  in  the\n    9  manner  prescribed in subdivision three [hereof] OF THIS SECTION, deter-\n   10  mine that it is in the public interest to authorize the increase in such\n   11  maximum amount.  [If  it is proposed or required  that  the  town  shall\n   12  finance  the  increase in the maximum amount proposed to be expended for\n   13  the improvement by the issuance of bonds, notes, certificates  or  other\n   14  evidences  of  indebtedness  and  the  total  estimated  expense of such\n   15  improvement including the increase in the maximum  amount  shall  exceed\n   16  one-tenth  of  one  per centum of the full valuation of the taxable real\n   17  property in the area of the town outside of villages, the town board may\n   18  not make an order pursuant to this subdivision unless the comptroller of\n   19  the state of New York shall have made, subsequent to the public  hearing\n   20  required  by  this  subdivision, an order approving the increase in such\n   21  maximum amount as stated in the  notice  of  hearing  required  by  this\n   22  subdivision.    The order of the comptroller shall be prepared in dupli-\n   23  cate and one copy thereof filed in the office of the department of audit\n   24  and control and the other copy in the office of the town  clerk  of  the\n   25  town.]   If the original authorization of the improvement was subject to\n   26  a permissive referendum pursuant to paragraph (a) of subdivision  eleven\n   27  of  this section or made subject to a mandatory or permissive referendum\n   28  pursuant to paragraph (b) of subdivision eleven  of  this  section,  any\n   29  order  of  the  town  board increasing the maximum amount to be expended\n   30  shall be subject to the same type of referendum.\n   31    S 3. Paragraphs (c) and (d) of subdivision 6 of section 54 of the town\n   32  law, as amended by chapter 938 of the laws of 1963, are amended to  read\n   33  as follows:\n   34    (c)  If the town board shall determine that it is in the public inter-\n   35  est,  the  board  may  adopt a resolution authorizing such improvement[,\n   36  subject to the approval of the state comptroller where such approval  is\n   37  required  by  subdivision  thirteen  of this section].   Such resolution\n   38  shall contain a statement of the  manner  in  which  the  costs  of  the\n   39  improvement  are  to be apportioned, and a description of the boundaries\n   40  of the benefited area, if any, as finally determined by the  town  board\n   41  where  any  part of the cost is to be raised by special assessments upon\n   42  benefited property.\n   43    (d)  The town clerk shall cause a certified copy of any resolution  or\n   44  order  adopted  pursuant  to this subdivision, subdivision five or para-\n   45  graph (c) of subdivision eight of this section, or  section  fifty-seven\n   46  of this [chapter] ARTICLE to be duly recorded in the office of the clerk\n   47  of  the  county  in  which the town is located within ten days after the\n   48  adoption of such resolution[, or within  ten  days  of  the  receipt  of\n   49  notification  of  the  approval  of  the  state  comptroller  where such\n   50  approval is required by subdivision five or subdivision thirteen of this\n   51  section].   When so  recorded,  such  resolution  shall  be  presumptive\n   52  evidence  of  the regularity of the proceedings and actions taken by the\n   53  town board in relation thereto.\n   54    S 4. Subdivision 13 of section 54 of the  town  law  is  REPEALED  and\n   55  subdivision 14 is renumbered subdivision 13.\n\n       A. 832                              3\n\n    1    S 5. Subdivision 2 of section 170 of the town law, as amended by chap-\n    2  ter 273 of the laws of 1960, is amended to read as follows:\n    3    2.   Upon its own motion and without a petition, the town board of any\n    4  town or, if the district as proposed or proposed to be extended includes\n    5  territory in more than one town, the town boards of each  of  the  towns\n    6  acting  jointly by a majority vote of the members of each of such boards\n    7  may establish or extend fire districts or fire protection  districts  in\n    8  such town or towns outside of any incorporated village or city or exist-\n    9  ing fire, fire alarm or fire protection district therein, after a public\n   10  hearing  thereon.    The  notice  of such hearing shall be published and\n   11  posted and such hearing shall be held in the  manner  provided  in  this\n   12  article  for a hearing upon the establishment of a fire district or fire\n   13  protection district upon petition.   After such  hearing  and  upon  the\n   14  evidence  given  thereat,  the  town  board or boards shall determine by\n   15  resolution whether it  be  in  the  public  interest  to  establish  the\n   16  proposed  fire district or fire protection district or extend the exist-\n   17  ing fire district or fire protection district, as the case may be.    If\n   18  it be determined that the establishment or extension of such district be\n   19  in the public interest, the town board or boards shall determine whether\n   20  all  the  property,  property  owners  and interested persons within the\n   21  proposed district are benefited thereby  and  whether  all  property  or\n   22  property  owners  benefited  are included therein and such town board or\n   23  boards shall so alter the boundaries of the proposed district or  exten-\n   24  sion,  so  that  all property and property owners and only such property\n   25  and property owners as  are  benefited  shall  be  included  within  its\n   26  limits.    In  the  event,  however, that it is found that any property,\n   27  property owners or any interested persons not included in the  district,\n   28  as  originally  proposed,  will  be  benefited thereby, a further notice\n   29  shall be posted and published and another hearing held as provided here-\n   30  in, unless all said additional property  owners  or  interested  persons\n   31  execute  and  file  written  consents to be included in such district or\n   32  extension.  When the boundaries of such FIRE DISTRICT,  fire  protection\n   33  district or extension shall have been finally determined, the town board\n   34  or  boards  shall  adopt  a  resolution  establishing  or  extending the\n   35  district and shall comply with the  provisions  of  subdivision  one  of\n   36  section  one  hundred seventy-three of this [chapter] ARTICLE. [When the\n   37  boundaries of such fire district or extension shall  have  been  finally\n   38  determined  the  town board or boards shall adopt a resolution approving\n   39  the establishment or extension of the district, and  shall  comply  with\n   40  the  provisions  of  subdivisions  two  and  four of section one hundred\n   41  seventy-three of this chapter, other than filing a certified copy  of  a\n   42  petition  as  provided  in such subdivision two.]  A fire district shall\n   43  not be extended pursuant to the provisions of  this  subdivision  except\n   44  upon  the  consent in writing of a majority of the commissioners of such\n   45  fire district.  Such consent shall be acknowledged or proved in the same\n   46  manner as a deed to be recorded.\n   47    S 6. Subdivision 2 of section 171 of the town law, as amended by chap-\n   48  ter 397 of the laws of 1995 and paragraph a as amended by chapter 631 of\n   49  the laws of 2004, is amended to read as follows:\n   50    2.  [a.] The town board or town boards shall  hold  a  public  hearing\n   51  upon  such  petition and shall cause a notice thereof to be published at\n   52  least once in a newspaper having general circulation  in  the  territory\n   53  affected, the first publication thereof to be not less than ten days nor\n   54  more than twenty days before the day designated therein for the hearing,\n   55  and  the  town clerk or town clerks shall cause copies of such notice to\n   56  be posted on the sign-board of the town maintained pursuant to  subdivi-\n\n       A. 832                              4\n\n    1  sion  six  of  section thirty of this chapter, and conspicuously in such\n    2  other places within or without the territory affected as the town  board\n    3  or  town  boards may direct, not less than ten nor more than twenty days\n    4  before  the  day  designated  for the hearing as aforesaid. In the event\n    5  that the town maintains a website, such information may also be provided\n    6  on the website. Such notice shall contain a description of the  proposed\n    7  district  or extension, state the estimated rate per thousand dollars of\n    8  assessed valuation, based on the aggregate assessed valuation of taxable\n    9  real property of the proposed district or extension  district  shown  in\n   10  the  latest  completed  final assessment roll, projected to be assessed,\n   11  levied and collected for purposes of the proposed district  or  extended\n   12  district  for the fiscal year of its operation and specify the time when\n   13  and the place where the town board or boards will meet to consider  such\n   14  petition  and  to  hear all persons interested in the subject concerning\n   15  the same. If the petition shall provide for the dissolution of an exist-\n   16  ing water supply district upon the establishment of the  fire  district,\n   17  the  notice  of  hearing shall so specify. If, upon the establishment or\n   18  extension of a fire district, the fire district would become the sponsor\n   19  of a service award program pursuant to section two hundred sixteen-b  of\n   20  the  general  municipal  law, the notice of hearing shall so specify and\n   21  contain a statement of the estimated annual cost of  the  service  award\n   22  program  to  the  fire  district;  provided,  however, that if, upon the\n   23  establishment or extension of a fire district, the ensuing fire district\n   24  would become the sponsor of a service award program pursuant to  section\n   25  two  hundred  sixteen-b  of  the  general municipal law, the resolutions\n   26  establishing the districts shall be submitted in each such town  in  the\n   27  manner  provided by article seven of this chapter. Prior to the publica-\n   28  tion of the notice, the board or boards shall cause to be prepared,  and\n   29  file  for  public inspection with the town clerk, a detailed explanation\n   30  of how the estimated rate of assessment for  the  proposed  district  or\n   31  extended district was computed.\n   32    [b.  (1)  If  the  permission of the state comptroller is not required\n   33  pursuant to section one hundred seventy-three of this article because it\n   34  is not proposed to finance an expenditure for the district or  extension\n   35  by  the  issuance  of  bonds,  notes, certificates or other evidences of\n   36  indebtedness of the fire district, a certified copy of the notice  shall\n   37  be filed with the state comptroller on or about the date of the publica-\n   38  tion of such notice.\n   39    (2)  Notwithstanding  the provisions of subparagraph one of this para-\n   40  graph the state comptroller shall not be precluded  from  requiring  the\n   41  submission  of additional information or data in such form and detail as\n   42  the state comptroller shall deem sufficient or from causing an  investi-\n   43  gation  to  be  made with respect to the establishment or extension of a\n   44  district or an increase in the maximum amount to be expended.]\n   45    S 7. Section 173 of the town law, as amended by  chapter  191  of  the\n   46  laws  of  1946,  subdivision  1 as amended by chapter 310 of the laws of\n   47  1962, the opening paragraph and  paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision  2  and\n   48  subdivision  4  as  amended by chapter 397 of the laws of 1995, subpara-\n   49  graph 1 of paragraph (a) of subdivision 2 as amended by  chapter  37  of\n   50  the  laws of 2000 and paragraph (b) of subdivision 2 as amended by chap-\n   51  ter 156 of the laws of 1956, is amended to read as follows:\n   52    S 173.

When so\n    9  recorded, such resolution shall be presumptive evidence of the regulari-\n   10  ty of the establishment, extension, consolidation, dissolution or alter-\n   11  ation of such district or districts.   The  expense  of  such  recording\n   12  shall  be a charge against the district or districts.  The said determi-\n   13  nation shall be final  and  conclusive  unless  a  proceeding  has  been\n   14  commenced  for review in the manner provided by article seventy-eight of\n   15  the civil practice law and rules within thirty days  from  the  time  of\n   16  recording thereof.\n   17    2.  [Whenever the town board or boards shall adopt a resolution estab-\n   18  lishing or extending a fire district for which it is  proposed  that  an\n   19  expenditure  is  to be financed by the issuance of bonds, notes, certif-\n   20  icates or other evidences of indebtedness of  the  fire  district,  such\n   21  resolution  or determination shall be submitted to the state comptroller\n   22  for approval in the following manner:\n   23    (a)  Within ten days after the adoption of  a  resolution  by  a  town\n   24  board  approving  the establishment or extension of such a district, the\n   25  town clerk of the town shall file a certified copy of  such  resolution,\n   26  in duplicate, in the office of the state department of audit and control\n   27  at  Albany,  New  York,  together with an application, in duplicate, for\n   28  permission to create or extend such district as the case may be.    Such\n   29  application shall be executed and verified by the supervisor, or by such\n   30  other  officer  of the town as the town board shall determine, and shall\n   31  include the following:\n   32    (1)  A certified copy of the petition,  if  there  is  one,  omitting,\n   33  however,  the  signatures  and acknowledgments or proofs, or authentica-\n   34  tions.\n   35    (2)  An itemized statement of the existing indebtedness of  the  town,\n   36  both  temporary  and  bonded, including the indebtedness of the town for\n   37  all special district purposes.\n   38    (3)  A statement of the aggregate assessed valuation  of  the  taxable\n   39  real  property  situated  in the proposed district or extension thereof,\n   40  and, if there is a petition, of the portion thereof  owned  by  resident\n   41  owners.\n   42    (b)  Whenever  such an application shall be filed in the office of the\n   43  department of audit and control, the state comptroller shall within five\n   44  days thereafter give notice thereof to the board of supervisors  of  the\n   45  county in which such proposed district or extension is located by filing\n   46  with  the  clerk  of such board of supervisors one copy of such applica-\n   47  tion.  At any time within fifteen days of the filing of the application,\n   48  said board of supervisors may file an  objection,  in  writing,  in  the\n   49  office  of said department of audit and control.  In addition, the state\n   50  comptroller shall determine whether the public interest will  be  served\n   51  by  the  creation or extension of the district and also whether the cost\n   52  thereof will be an undue  burden  upon  the  property  of  the  proposed\n   53  district  or  extension.    The state comptroller may make such determi-\n   54  nations upon  the  original  or  any  amended  application,  or  in  his\n   55  discretion  may require the submission of additional information or data\n   56  in such form and detail as he shall deem sufficient,  or  may  cause  an\n\n       A. 832                              6\n\n    1  investigation  to be made, to aid him in making the determinations above\n    2  mentioned.\n    3    3.  Upon the expiration of fifteen days from the date of the filing of\n    4  such  application  with  the  clerk of the board of supervisors and upon\n    5  reaching a determination, the comptroller shall make an order, in dupli-\n    6  cate, granting or denying permission for the creation  or  extension  of\n    7  the  district and shall file one copy of such order in the office of the\n    8  state department of audit and control at Albany, New York, and the other\n    9  in the office of the town clerk  of  the  town  in  which  the  proposed\n   10  district  or  extension  is located.   The town clerk shall present such\n   11  order to the town board of the town at the next meeting thereof.\n   12    4.
