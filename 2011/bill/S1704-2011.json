  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1704\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the education law, in relation to establishing guidelines for\nfiling complaints against students who commit crimes against other\nstudents on school grounds\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nThis bill would allow school\ndistricts to create rules to allow schools to file criminal\ncomplaints against students who commit crimes against other students\nor engage in harassing, bullying, menacing or threatening behavior to\nother students on school grounds both with the consent of the\nvictim's parents or guardians and/or without the consent of the\nparents and or guardians.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nMost parents and members of communities believe that\nschools should be places where children develop intellectually and\nsocially. The idea that school violence, in whatever form, interferes\nwith the orderly operation and safety of schools is anathema to the\npublic. Beyond concerns about physical injury to children, disruption\nof the school environment interferes with others' learning and can\ncreate a climate of fear in which children avoid school or engage in\nbehaviors to protect themselves. Over the last few sessions, we have\ncontinually fought in the budget process to give resources to our\nlocal schools to make sure students get a safe quality education.\nSchools need the ability to provide a safe environment which is just\nas important as the quality of the education. Order in the schools is\nnecessary. By giving the schools tools such as alternative learning\nsettings for disruptive students and now the ability to swear out a\ncriminal complaint against violent students, we can provide a good\nenvironment for all other students.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.4653 of 2009\n04/27/09 REFERRED TO EDUCATION\n01/06/10 REFERRED TO EDUCATION\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to state\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the one hundred\neightieth day after it shall become a law: provided, however that any\nrule or regulation necessary for this implementation of this act on\nits effective date shall be promulgated on or before such date.\n\n",
