  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1398\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public service law, in relation to converting residential\nrental buildings from being mass-metered to submetered\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nTo provide for a transparent procedure by which a private or\ngovernment entity applying for submeter a residential rental building\nshall make certain facts of the building known that pertain to its\nenergy efficiency, require minimum improvements to the building for\nenergy efficiency, and provide for tenant input as the application is\nconsidered by the Public Service Commission.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThe public service law is amended to:\n\n-Provide that a master-metered residential rental building may be\nconverted to submetering if a private or government entity providing\nelectric services files an application with the Public Service\nCommission and meets the conditions of this act;\n\n-Requires the applicant to include in the application a procedure for\nwritten notification to tenants of the proposal to submeter within 30\ndays of the application, the notification shall include: a summary of\nthe information provided to the commission, inform the tenants that a\npublic comment period has commenced, and indicate the length of that\ncomment period; the address and telephone number of the nearest\nCommission office; the date, time, and location of a public hearing\nset by the Commission to hear testimony from the public; where on the\nCommission website the entire application can be viewed and how a\nfree copy can be requested by mail as well as providing a toll free\nnumber for making such requests; a statement stating any economic\nadvantages of submetering at the premisis; a description of the\nsubmetering service that will be installed; the method of calculating\nutility rates for tenants, including information about the utility's\ntariffed residential rate for directly metered service; describe\ncompliant procedures and tenant protections consistent with the Home\nEnergy Fair Practice Act; demonstrate that arrangements have been\nmade with the local social services department to continue to provide\nelectric service upon acceptance of utility assistance grants.\n\n-Requires the Commission hold a public hearing near the residential\nbuilding at least 30 days prior to the conditional and final approval\nor denial of the submetering application;\n\n-Requires the applicant to provide to include in their application to\nthe Commission: findings of a study commissioned by the applicant of\nthe thermal characteristics of the building; records of the last\ntwenty-four months of electrical usage and charges; the projected\n\nsubmetered rates\nthat the current usage rate for the various dwelling types that exist\nin the building; a plan to replace all non-energy star rated\nappliances provided by the applicant to energy-star rated appliances;\n\n-The applicant shall pay all the costs of an independent energy\nconsultant chosen by the tenants if a group of at least 50% of the\ntenants request such analysis and at least 3 bids are received by the\napplicant;\n\n-Act taking effect immediately.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIn 1951, the Public Service Commission prohibited all residential\nelectric submetering, calling the practice \"parasitic.\" That decision\nwas held up in courts (Campo Corp. v. Feinberg, 279 App. Div. 302 (3d\nDept.\n1952) affirmed 303 N.Y. 995 (1952). As a consequence, utilities were\ndirected by the PSC to adopt electric tariffs broadly prohibiting the\nresale of utility service. The previously permitted landlord\nsubmetering was converted to direct utility metering.\n\nSubsequently, the practice of submetering was again allowed by the\nPSC on a case by case basis, mainly for residential cooperative and\ncondominium projects, where tenants have an ownership and governance\ninterest. Public service commission regulations and numerous orders\nhave allowed landlords waivers from the general prohibition against\nresale of utility service contained in commission regulations and\nutility tariffs.\nAs a result, landlords are being allowed to be monopoly providers of\nelectric service to their captive tenants. Also, in many instances\nthe state division of housing and community renewal has allowed\nlandlords who previously rented with utility service included in the\nrent to change the terms of leases so as to shift responsibility for\npayment of electric charges from landlords to tenants.\n\nTo safeguard the rights of tenants, it is important to ensure that the\nsubmetering application process is transparent and affords affected\nresidents the opportunity to comment on the application as well as\nensuring that the thermal characteristics of the building are known,\ndeficiencies in energy efficiency are reasonably mitigated, and that\nthere are checks in place to safeguard against tenants being unduly\nburdened from unjust and unreasonable submetered charges.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010: Referred to Energy & Telecommunications\n2009: Referred to Energy & Telecommunications\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
