  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1253\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the agriculture and markets law,\nin relation to the sale of birds by pet dealers\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo ensure the humane health of bird species before sale to the public,\nand the assurance that the public are purchasing optimal health birds.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nAn amendment is made to Section 402, subdivision 1, of the Agriculture\nand Markets law.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nThere are no existing laws for optimal health of bird species in pet\ndealer stores.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe public is usually unaware of a bird species health in pet dealer\nstores. While no pet dealer shall knowingly sell any cat or dog\nyounger than eight weeks of age, a bird can be sold at a young age\nsince there are no restrictions in place to prohibit a pet dealer\nfrom performing this act. Birds need to sustain a certain weight in\norder to fend and feed for themselves, so it is vital that they are\nsold at a later time.\n\nThis act, .should it become law, would require pet dealers to offer\nfor sale to the public those birds who sustain at least ninety of\ntheir respective body weight and no longer require \"hand-feeding\"\nfrom a pet dealer and/or the public. To ensure further oversight, pet\ndealers will be required to document the body weight of hand-fed\nbirds less than one year of age and note this weight on the sales\nreceipt.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-2010: S.4130 - Passed Consumer protection; Referred to Codes.\nReferred back to Consumer Protection for the 2010 legislative session.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nShall take effect on the sixtieth day after it becomes law.\n\n",
