  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1379\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the civil service law, in relation to requiring certain state\nagencies to employ a competitive class affirmative action officer or\nadministrator\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nThis legislation seeks to protect and strengthen the role of\naffirmative action officers in all state agencies by providing that\neach agency have a full-time affirmative action officer that reports\ndirectly to the agency head and are provided with continued education\nopportunities in the area of affirmative action, equal employment\nopportunity and human rights.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 - Article 2 of the civil service law is amended by adding a\nnew title A-1. This article defines the process by which state\naffirmative officers and administrators are hired into competitive\npositions that will allow them the latitude to perform their duties\nwithout fear of retaliation or job loss.\n\nSection 2 - requires that every affirmative action\nofficer/administrator employed by a state agency shall be employed\nthe agency head and report directly to that person and no one else in\nso as to provide these employees with access to the top decision\nmaking authority in that agency. This will help address the issue of\nlack of diversity in state agencies because workforce planning issues\nby agency heads will have input by such employees. Affirmative action\nofficers/ administrator are required to participate in recruitment\nand interviewing process.\n\nSection 3 - requires for the establishment of a continuing education\nprogram (CEP) for all affirmative action officers/administrators that\nwill help them gain the necessary skills to perform their jobs by\nlearning about rules and regulations relating to affirmative action,\nequal employment opportunity and human rights. Changes in these laws\nat both the federal and state level, and court decisions require such\nongoing training for these employees to be successful in their job\nrequirements.\nRequires that the CEP must be in place for 18 months prior to any\nexamination for AAO and AAA.\n\nSection 4 - This section requires that all state agencies that\nemployee 100 or more employees shall have a full-time affirmative\naction\nofficer/administrator. Presently, many agencies do not have a\ndedicated affirmative action officer/administrator and individuals\nnow performing such duties have conflict of interest situations\nbecause they have other job requirements and other job\n\nclassifications mixed with their affirmative action duties. In large\nagencies, these employees have no staff and are unable to perform\nthese duties effectively while having to focus on other job\nrequirements because of their dual job roles. This will eliminate\nsuch conflicts of interest and allow for affirmative action\nofficers/administrators to have civil rights as their sole\nresponsibility.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nA 2005 report by the New York State Assembly Puerto Rican/Hispanic\nTask Force, a subsequent public hearing and other meetings with\nminority workers has yielded valuable suggestion that need\nlegislative action to remedy what the 2005 report called, an\nappalling under-representation of minorities in civil service and\npolicy making positions in the Pataki Administration. This is one of\nfive proposals put forward by task force to address the problems.\n\nThe lack of workforce diversity now seen in New York State was created\nbecause over the years affirmative action officers/administrators\nhave no job protection, and are marginalized by agency heads. In\nfact, many of the current employee performing such duties are not\nMOs. This legislation reverses this situation and strengthens the\nrole of these employees by providing them with a variety of tools.\n\nThis legislation mandates that all affirmative action\nofficers/administrators shall be hired as competitive classified\npositions. The common practice of not providing AAAs and AAOs with\nprotected employment status has created fear and an inability to\nauthoritatively perform their duties.\n\nThis legislation will provide job security, promotion opportunities\nand require that these employees report directly to agency head and\nno one else. Presently AAOs report to a variety of low level managers\nthat show no priority in EEO guidelines. The result of this problem\nis documented by the findings of the report mentioned above:\n\n* Today, Hispanics make up over 16% of the entire state population but\naccount for only 3.8 percent or 6,515 of the 169,571 jobs in the\nstate government workforce. In real terms, this is a decline in close\nto 1,000 jobs since 1991 or a 12.2% reduction in the number of\nHispanic state workers. This reduction came during a period when the\nHispanic population in New York grew by 33%.\n\n* Since 1991, the African-American civil service workforce has seen a\ndramatic decline. The 8,836 jobs lost by this group represent a 26.7%\ndecline in the African-American state workforce. This reduction came\nduring a period when the African-American population in New York grew\nby 13.1%.\n\n* For African-Americans, the loss of the 8,836 jobs at the average\nstate salary of $53,000 translates into a loss of over $468 million\n\ndollars in annual salaries. For Hispanics their under-representation\ntranslates into a loss of over $860 million in annual salaries.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-10: Referred to Civil Service & Pensions; Reported and\nCommitted to Finance\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\nNot applicable.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall have\nbecome a law, provided that subdivision 4 of section 12-a of the\ncivil service law, as amended by section one of this act shall take\neffect on the 180th day after it shall have become a law.\n\n",
