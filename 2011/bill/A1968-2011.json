Notice of such\n   44  claim shall be sent by the clerk by [both ordinary first class mail and]\n   45  certified mail with return receipt requested  to  the  party  complained\n   46  against at his residence, if he resides within the city of New York, and\n   47  his  residence  is  known  to the claimant, or at his office or place of\n   48  regular employment within the city of New York if  he  does  not  reside\n   49  therein or his residence within the city of New York is not known to the\n   50  claimant.  [If, after the expiration of thirty days, such ordinary first\n   51  class  mailing  has  not  been  returned  as  undeliverable,  the  party\n   52  complained against shall be presumed to have  received  notice  of  such\n   53  claim.]\n   54    (5) Such procedure shall further provide for an early hearing upon and\n   55  determination  of such claim.

Either party may request that\n    2  the hearing be scheduled during evening hours, provided that the hearing\n    3  shall not be scheduled during evening hours if it would cause  unreason-\n    4  able  hardship  to  either  party. The court shall not unreasonably deny\n    5  requests for evening hearings if such requests are made by the  claimant\n    6  upon commencement of the action or by the party complained against with-\n    7  in fourteen days of receipt of the notice of claim.\n    8    S 3. This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to actions\n    9  commenced on and after such date.\n",
