  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2042\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public service law, in relation to deeming confirmed\nfranchise terms requirements of the public service commission\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill would provide the Public Service Commission with\nclear authority to enforce the requirements of municipal cable\nfranchises which have been confirmed by the Commission.\n\nSUMMARY:\nThis bill would amend subdivision 1 of section 227-a of the\nPublic Service Law, by adding language that makes the terms of\nmunicipal cable franchises, which have been confirmed by the\nCommission, requirements of the Commission, upon written request of\nthe municipality.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nInvestigations conducted by staff of the Committee\non Oversight, Analysis and Investigation, including a survey of all\nmunicipalities with cable franchises and interviews with numerous\nmunicipal officials, brought to light the difficulties many\nmunicipalities face in trying to obtain cable operator compliance\nwith franchise provisions.\nSmall- and medium-sized municipalities often do not have the resources\nto enforce requirements of their cable television franchises,\nparticularly when the cable operator refuses to comply with municipal\nrequests or directions. To force operators to comply, municipalities\nwould have to sue the operator, which may not be a feasible method of\nenforcement. Existing provisions of the Public Service Law require\ncable operators to comply with orders and requirements of the Public\nService Commission and enable the Commission to fine operators for\nnoncompliance.\n\nThe law also provides that municipal franchises cannot take effect\nwithout Commission approval. This bill would clearly authorize the\nCommission to obtain cable operator compliance with the terms of a\nmunicipal franchise that the Commission has approved. Municipalities\nwould retain their existing powers to enforce their own franchises\nand the Public Service Commission's jurisdiction to enforce municipal\nfranchise terms would take effect only upon the written request of\nthe municipality.\nThe amended bill conforms bill language to changes wrought by Chapter\n83 of the Laws of 1995. That Chapter abolished the State Commission\non Cable Television and transferred its cable regulatory functions to\nthe Public Service Commission. That Chapter also moved statutory\ncable regulation provisions from the Executive Law to the Public\nService Law.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the first of July\nfollowing the date on which it shall have become law.\n\n",
