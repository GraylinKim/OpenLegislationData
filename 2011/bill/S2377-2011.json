  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2377\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the criminal procedure law, in relation to authorizing peace\nofficers designated by the superintendent of insurance to execute arrest\nwarrants and search warrants\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo facilitate the investigation and prosecution of insurance fraud in\nNew York State by authorizing insurance fraud investigators to\nexecute arrest warrants and search warrants.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThis bill would amend sections 120.10 and 120.50 of the criminal\nprocedure law to authorize Insurance Department fraud investigators\nto execute arrest warrants. This bill would also amend section 690.25\nof the criminal procedure law to authorize fraud investigators to\nexecute search warrants.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nAuto insurance premiums are increasing, particularly down state, and\ninsurance fraud is the main cause of these increases. Insurance fraud\ncosts New York consumers over $1 billion per year in increased\npremiums and this number continues to grow. We need to do all we can\nto ensure that the criminals profiting from insurance fraud are put\nin jail where they belong and this bill will further this goal by\nensuring that Insurance Department Frauds Bureau investigators are\nable to fight insurance fraud without being hindered because they\nlack the authority to independently execute search and arrest warrants.\n\nThe mission of the Insurance Fraud Bureau is to investigate\nallegations of insurance fraud and assist in the prosecution of\noffenders. Penalties for insurance fraud range from a class A\nmisdemeanor to a class B felony. In addition to enforcing penal law\nprovisions relating to insurance fraud, Fraud Bureau investigators\nregularly identify other violations of laws perpetrated by persons\nunder investigation. Most insurance fraud investigators are former\npolice officers with significant law enforcement investigative\nexperience. Despite these qualifications,\nunder current law, fraud investigators are unable to arrest a felon\nwho they may encounter in carrying out their duties.\n\nUnder current law, Insurance Fraud Bureau investigators are\ndesignated as peace officers and are unable to act independently in\nthe execution of search and arrest warrants. Rather, investigators\nare currently required to coordinate with other law enforcement\nagencies to execute these functions, resulting in delays and\nhindering their ability to apprehend individuals committing insurance\nfraud. Insurance fraud may not be a priority of local police\ndepartments who may already be understaffed, which may result in\ndelays and deter the investigation and prosecution of insurance\n\nfraud. This bill would give fraud investigators the authority to\nindependently execute search and arrest warrants, thereby\nfacilitating their apprehension of criminals engaging in insurance\nfraud.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.3054 of 2009-10; S.2453 of 2007-2008\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to the state.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n90 days after becoming a law.\n\n",
