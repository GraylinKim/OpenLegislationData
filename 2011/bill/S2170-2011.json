  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2170\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the public health law, in relation to the shipment of\ncigarettes\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nThis bill would amend the Public Health Law provisions related to the\nshipment of cigarettes by allowing local enforcement and injunctive\nrelief, and by providing clarifying language so that government\nemployees may conduct sting operations.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nThe State's landmark cigarette shipment statute, which effectively\nprohibits the retail sale of cigarettes through the mail or common\ncarriers, has withstood multiple attacks in courts. The statute\nservices both public health purposes of keeping cigarettes away from\nminors and revenue integrity purposes by ensuring that taxes on\ncigarettes are paid.\n\nThese amendments strengthen the statue in several ways. First, the\ncurrent wording of subdivision 1 provides an unintended defense to\ngovernment \"sting\" operations, as it provides that compliance with\nthe statute is not necessary when a government employee makes a\npurchase otherwise prohibited by the statute, in the course of their\nduties. Therefore, if a State or City worker were to conduct a sting\noperation by purchasing cigarettes in violation of the statute, a\nseller could have a defense that the law was not broken as the\nofficial was purchasing the cigarettes in the course of their duties,\nand that therefore compliance with the law was not needed. The bill\nadds language in section 1 to correct this potential problem.\n\nFurther, Section 1 clarifies the civil penalty to be up to $5,000 per\nviolation or $100/pack of cigarettes shipped.\n\nThe amendments in Section two of the bill provide for more effective\nenforcement, both through the injunctive relief provisions, and by\nallowing local governments to enforce the statute and collect civil\npenalties. Through these changes, maximum enforcement of the statute\nwill be ensured and repeated violators will be subject to injunctive\nrelief, rather than fines, which can often be carried as part of the\ncost of doing business.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\nS.2001/A.7326 of 2007-08 (Passed Assembly); S.5638-B of 2005-06\nS.2324/A.1833 of 2009-10 (Passed Assembly)\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nImmediately.\n\n",
