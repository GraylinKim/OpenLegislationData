  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1370\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act providing for the creation of a temporary state commission to\ndetermine the future governance of the canal corporation; and providing\nfor the repeal of such provisions upon expiration thereof\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nThis Bill proposes\nto create a temporary commission on the future governance of the canal\ncorporation. Upon collecting information and its general finding the\ngroup is to convene and report all recommendations.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 calls for the creation of a temporary commission to study the\nproper placement of the canal corporation.\n\nSection 2 calls for the commission to consist of thirteen members\nappointed with; seven members appointed by the governor, two by the\ntemporary president of the senate, two members by the speaker of the\nassembly, and one to be appointed by minority leaders from each house.\nThe governor appoints the head of the commission for his appointees.\n\nSection 3 delineates that members of the commission are not to receive\ncompensation but that all necessary expenditures shall be included.\n\nSection 4 mandates that all employments and removals are subject to the\ncommission's consent. Further, fixing compensation within the available\namounts lies under the commission's authority.\n\nSection 5 states that the commission will meet within the state, hold\npublic hearings, and maintain all necessary powers of a legislative\ncommittee.\n\nSection 6. requires that after commencement the commission shall procure\nall findings and evaluation. From these findings, no later than one year\nafter origination, the. commission will draft a culminating report for\nthe governor, the temporary president of the senate, and the speaker or\nthe assembly.\n\nSection 7 gives the effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nSince the incorporation of the Erie\ncanal by the New York state thruway authority, there has been a\nnoticeable drain on their resources. As a result, tolls and other fees\nare set to increase necessitating a new approach towards managing the\ncanal corporation. With research and management the commission would\neffectively re-incorporate the canal corporation, emphasizing on making\nit fiscally manageable. Rather than litigating on different bills; the\ncreation of a bi-partisan committee -- specifically drafting policy\ndirectly correlating with the governing of the canal--would be most\n\neffective. With enough consideration to the particulars the canal will\nbe safely managed, and realized that the canal may not be classified as\na major transportation route so the incorporation under the State\nThruway system may be outdated. The committee will have roots in every\naspect of the New York state legislature, so it shall be assumed that\nquick and effective legislation will come of the committee.\n\nMedia and public attention have started to key in to this issue;\nrealizing its ramifications. Times Union reports that, \"Michael\nFleischer, the authority's executive director, said the Thruway's\nfinancial outlook no longer provides enough funding to support a $2.7\nbillion capital repair and improvement plan that was approved with the\nphased toll hikes in 2005. Most of that program -- just over $2.1\nbillion -- is for basic maintenance and repairs to core highway\ninfrastructure, such as bridges and pavement, he said.\" Beyond their own\ntroubling costs, the overall maintenance of the canal corporation will\nonly drastically increase the already rising tolls on the New York state\nthruway. The committee will work with members from all different public\ngroups to figure out the quickest and most financially viable solutions.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-10:  S.4957/A.495\n2008:     S.6873/A.9849\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n120 days after becoming law.\n\n",
