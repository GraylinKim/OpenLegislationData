  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2108\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the general business law, in relation to prohibiting the\nsale or rental of indecent material near a school or place of worship\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo prohibit the sale or rental of indecent\nmaterials, as\ndefined in the penal law, within 200 feet of a school or place of\nworship.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThe bill amends the general\nbusiness law by\nadding a section which makes it unlawful for any person, firm or\ncorporation to sell, offer for sale, rent, offer to rent, or display\nindecent material, as defined in section 235.21 of the penal law,\nwithin 200 feet of any public or private primary or secondary school,\nchurch, synagogue, or other place of worship.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nThe bill amends the general business\nlaw by adding a new\nsection 397-a. Currently, no such prohibition exists.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nUnder section 235.21 of the penal law,\nit is already a\ncrime to distribute indecent material to minors. In keeping with the\nlaw's attempt to keep harmful material away from minors, this bill\nwould prevent their sale, rental, or display within 200 feet of\nschools and places of worship. That children on their way to these\nplaces, which offer enlightenment and uplift, must encounter such\nmaterials and the establishments which peddle them is unfortunate,\nunseemly, and potentially damaging.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the\nfirst of September\nnext succeeding the date on which it shall have become a law.\n\n",
