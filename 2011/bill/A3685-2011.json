The method of marking, preparing and mailing such ballot for\n   51  voting shall conform, wherever practicable,  to  the  methods  used  for\n   52  absentee  ballots  for  a  general election, except that the envelope in\n   53  which it is contained shall be returned to the village clerk. On the day\n   54  of the election, the village clerk shall deliver all such ballots, which\n   55  have been returned to him OR HER, in the sealed envelopes to  the  board\n   56  of  inspectors  of  election  of the proper election district.   No such\n\n       A. 3685                             4\n\n    1  ballot shall be deemed to have been voted unless or until it shall  have\n    2  been  delivered  to  the board of inspectors of election of the election\n    3  district in which the elector casting the ballot resides and shall  have\n    4  been  deposited  by  the  chairman of such board in the box provided for\n    5  receiving such ballot.\n    6    [8] 9.  When such ballots shall have been delivered to  the  board  of\n    7  inspectors  of  election  of the proper election district and shall have\n    8  been duly determined by such board to have been lawfully cast by a qual-\n    9  ified elector of such district, the chairman of such board shall,  after\n   10  the  close of the polls, open the envelopes containing such ballots and,\n   11  without unfolding such ballots or permitting  the  face  thereof  to  be\n   12  exposed  to  the view of anyone, shall deposit each such ballot in a box\n   13  specifically furnished for such purpose by the  village  clerk.  If  the\n   14  board  of  inspectors shall determine that any such ballot has been cast\n   15  by an elector who would not be qualified under the  provisions  of  this\n   16  section, then such ballot shall not be counted.\n   17    [9]  10.    After  all  the ballots shall have been deposited, the box\n   18  shall be opened and such ballots canvassed in the same manner  as  other\n   19  ballots  cast  at such election and shall be counted and included in the\n   20  total of all ballots cast at such election.\n   21    S 2. This act shall take effect immediately.\n",
