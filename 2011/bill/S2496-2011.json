  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2496\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the insurance law, in relation to inspections of private\npassenger automobiles prior to the provision of coverage for physical\ndamage thereto\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill allows an auto insurer to waive the right to inspect a motor\nvehicle prior to issuing an insurance policy if such insurer has\ntiled a plan of operation to ensure that vehicles covered under such\npolicy have not sustained physical damage.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1: Amends Insurance Law section 3411 to permit an auto insurer\nto waive the physical inspection of an automobile prior to insuring\nsuch a vehicle. In addition, an insured can receive coverage after\nsustaining an accident without first having the vehicle inspected if\nsuch insurance carrier has filed a plan of operation with the\nSuperintendent of Insurance.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nUnder current law, all motor vehicles must be inspected prior to being\ncovered under an auto insurance policy.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nThe prior inspection law was first enacted almost a quarter century\nago to address problems of fraudulent damages to motor vehicles that\nwere covered after the accident had been sustained.\nSince 1984, mandatory equipment can be verified by standardized\nVehicle Identification Numbers (VIN) adopted by the auto industry in\nthe 1980's. Fraudulent policies purchased after an accident has taken\nplace can easily be identified through today's new computer\ntechnology that pinpoints where and when a call was made and when a\nvehicle had been in an accident or\nrepaired. While some may still attempt to purchase policies for\nphantom vehicles, today's modern Special Investigation Units (SIU's)\nare far better equipped to identify such issues that their\ncounterparts of the 1970's\n\nThe magnitude of this aspect of auto insurance fraud is not large\nenough to warrant the cost and unintended consequences of the\nexisting law. The current regulation, as prescribed by section 3411,\nis complex and expensive for insurers to comply with, which drives up\nthe overall cost for all auto insurance in New York.\n\nIn addition, under current law, people who have no intention of\ncommitting auto insurance fraud can find at the time of an accident,\nthat they have lost coverage for such an accident because no auto\n\ninspection was performed. In this situation, the insured has\npurchased coverage and paid the premium, but will not be covered\nif his or her auto sustains physical property damage simply because\nthe auto was inadvertently not inspected.\n\nThe intent of this bill is simply to remove the burden from the\nDepartment of crafting a one size fits all solution to reform this\nrequirement that all vehicles must be physically inspected. It allows\neach insurer to either comply with the existing physical inspection\nlaws or, if it wants to, to develop its own plan of operation to\nensure that it does not cover autos after a physical damage claim has\nbeen sustained. For example, an insurer may require physical\ninspections for auto that are valued over a certain monetary\nthreshold or rely more on new technologies that can identify those\nvehicles that have already sustained physical damages.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.2023 of 2007/2008\nS.1039 of 2009/2010\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nJanuary first, next succeeding the date upon which it shall have\nbecome law, and apply to polices issued or renewed after such date.\n\n",
