  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1811\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nCONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY\nproposing an amendment\nto section 26 of article 6 of the constitution, in relation to\nauthorizing district court judges to serve as family court judges\n\nPURPOSE:\nA constitutional amendment to allow a district court judge to serve as\na family court judge in the judicial district of his or her residence.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1. Subdivision (h) of section 26 of article 6 of the\nconstitution is amended to allow a judge of the district court in any\ncounty to be temporarily assigned to the family court in the judicial\ndistrict of his or her residence.\n\nSection 2. Resolved (if the Assembly concur), that the foregoing\namendment be referred to the first regular legislative session\nconvening after the next succeeding general election of members of\nthe assembly, and, in conformity with section 1 of article 19 of the\nconstitution, be published for 3 months previous to the time of such\nelection.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nNew York State allows county court judges to act as and discharge the\nduties of family court judges, however, New York State district court\njudges seem to have been overlooked. By allowing New York State\ndistrict court judges to act as family court judges, case loads and\ndelays can be reduced and personal attention to each matter can be\nincreased.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010:  S.8300\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nResolved (if the Assembly concur), That the foregoing amendment be\nreferred to the first regular legislative session convening after the\nnext succeeding general election of members of the Assembly,\nand, in\nconformity with section 1 of article 19 of the constitution, be\npublished for 3 months previous to the time of such election.\n\n",
