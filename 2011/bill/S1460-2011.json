  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1460\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the insurance law, in relation to windstorm insurance notice\nregarding deductibles\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo clearly define the \"trigger\" or conditions defining the term\ncatastrophic windstorm in the insurance law and place a maximum\namount deductible on windstorm damage in homeowner's policies.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nAmends &sect;3445 of the Insurance Law to clarify that catastrophic\nwindstorm damage deductibles shall only be applicable to hurricanes\nwith windspeeds of 125 miles per hour or greater and limits the\ndeductible to a maximum of $1500.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe residents of the coastal areas of the state have been for the past\nfew years, subject to a homeowner's insurance market that has\nvacillated and fluctuated. Without real damage experience in these\nareas, insurance companies have instituted policies of huge\ndeductibles predicated on hurricanes with minimum windspeeds. This\nbill will provide those residents with a stable market with\nreasonable coverage.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-10 S.241; S.139, 2007-08; S.716, 2005-06; S.724, 2003-04; S.2080,\n2001-02; 1999-00, S.4982.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
