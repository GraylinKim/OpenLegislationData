  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1432\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the education law, in relation to the effect of mandates on\nschool districts\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nThis bill would require that any state mandate imposing a cost upon a\nschool district may not be imposed after the adoption of a school\nbudget. This provision allows school districts to plan for and\nincorporate a new state imposed mandate in their upcoming school\nbudget.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nSection one amends the education law by adding a new section 308-a\nwhich defines mandates and prohibits implementation of unfunded\nmandates during a school fiscal year in which a budget has already\nbeen adopted. Allows implementation of a new mandate which imposes\ncosts on school districts in the following school fiscal year.\n\nSection two provides that the act shall become effective immediately.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nOver the last several years, the State Legislature has been\nparticularly sensitive to school districts' concerns regarding the\nimposition of unfunded state mandates, however, the federal\ngovernment and the State Education Department continue to impose new\nfiscal requirements on public schools without regard to their ability\nto plan for the fiscal implications. Without adequate funding and\ntime to plan for unforeseen costs, school districts have, at times,\nbeen forced to reduce programs, services and personnel to contend\nwith new unfunded mandates imposed by the state.\n\nIn December 2006, the State Education Department directed all public\nschool districts to provide students taking mandated state math exams\nwith graphing and/or scientific calculators to the extent that such\ncalculators are a necessary part of the educational program.\nSpecifically, school\ndistricts were informed by the State Education Department that the\ncalculators must be provided to students when required in order to\ncomplete mandated State math and science assessments and course work.\nThis particular regulation imposed a cost of roughly $100 million\nstatewide. Some school districts reported spending in excess of\n$100,000 on graphing and scientific calculators to fulfill this\nunforeseen requirement.\n\nIn order to ensure that school districts and taxpayers do not bave to\ncontend with costly new mandates once a school budget has been\nadopted, this legislation provides schools with the time to adjust\nand plan for any new state mandates imposing a cost on a school\ndistrict.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n2009-2010: S.1252 - Referred to Education.\n2007-2008: S.5671 -- Passed Senate.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nImmediately.\n\n",
