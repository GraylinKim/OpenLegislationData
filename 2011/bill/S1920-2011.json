All owners of the property who primarily reside thereon\n    6  must  jointly  file an application for exemption with the assessor on or\n    7  before the appropriate taxable status  date.  Such  application  may  be\n    8  filed  by  mail  if  it  is  enclosed  in  a  postpaid envelope properly\n    9  addressed to the appropriate assessor, deposited in  a  post  office  or\n   10  official depository under the exclusive care of the United States postal\n   11  service, and postmarked by the United States postal service on or before\n   12  the  applicable taxable status date. Each such application shall be made\n   13  on a form prescribed by the commissioner, which shall require the appli-\n   14  cant or applicants to agree to notify  the  assessor  if  their  primary\n   15  residence  changes  while their property is receiving the exemption.

If the applicant requests a receipt from\n   21  the  assessor  as  proof  of submission of the application, the assessor\n   22  shall provide such receipt. If  such  request  is  made  by  other  than\n   23  personal  request, the applicant shall provide the assessor with a self-\n   24  addressed postpaid envelope in which to mail the receipt.\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD05718-02-1\n\n       S. 1920                             2\n\n    1    S 2. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 9-b of section 425 of the real prop-\n    2  erty tax law, as amended by chapter 742 of  the  laws  of  2005  and  as\n    3  further  amended  by  section  1  of part W of chapter 56 of the laws of\n    4  2010, is amended to read as follows:\n    5    (b)  In the case of persons who have not elected to participate in the\n    6  STAR income verification program, the enhanced exemption shall apply for\n    7  a term of one year. To continue receiving  such  enhanced  exemption,  a\n    8  SIMPLIFIED,  SHORT  FORM renewal application must be filed annually with\n    9  the assessor on or before the applicable taxable status date on  a  form\n   10  prescribed  by  the  commissioner.  Provided, however, that if a renewal\n   11  application is not so filed, the assessor shall discontinue the enhanced\n   12  exemption but shall grant the basic exemption, subject to the provisions\n   13  of subdivision eleven of this section.\n   14    S 3. This act shall take effect immediately.\n",
