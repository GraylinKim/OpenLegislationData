  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1741\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to the crime of facilitating a sex\noffense through electronic communication\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 - adds a new section 130.93 of the\nPenal Law to provide that a person is guilty of facilitating a sex\noffense through electronic communication if he or she, with intent to\ncause sexual contact with another person, knowingly encourages,\nsuggests, orders, aids or otherwise participates through electronic\ncommunication with one or more persons to engage in a sex offense as\ndefined in Article 130. The section further provides that\nfacilitating a sex offense through electronic communication is a\nclass D felony.\n\nSection 2 - amends 120.40 of the Penal Law by adding a new subdivision\n6 defining \"electronic communication.\"\n\nSection 3 - provides that the act shall take effect on the first of\nNovember next succeeding the date on which it shall have become a law.\n\nPURPOSE AND JUSTIFICATION:\nCurrently, there are no\nlaws in New York\nthat specifically address persons who participate in sexual offenses\nby watching them over the internet and in some cases actively\nparticipate, albeit at a distance, in the offenses through\ncommunication and suggestions by e-mail or other long-distance\nmessaging. In a recent incident in Western New York, a pedophile\nbroadcast his abuse of a young child over the internet, and persons\nwatching are alleged to have made suggestions as to criminal\nactivities as they watched. Such behavior, which can encourage\ncriminal behavior, is as heinous as the actions of the actual\nperpetrator.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nArticle 130 of the Penal Law sets forth various sexual offenses.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-10 - S.2108/A.3789 - Codes\n2007-08 - S.2323A/A.5883A - PASSED SENATE/Codes\n2005-06 - S.5839/A.10752 -  PASSED SENATE/Codes\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNo additional costs to the state or local governments.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis act shall take effect on the first of November\nnext succeeding the date on which it shall have become a law.\n\n",
