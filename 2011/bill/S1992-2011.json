  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1992\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the executive law, in relation to inquiries about certain\nsealed convictions; and to repeal section 160.58 of the criminal\nprocedure law relating to conditional sealing of certain controlled\nsubstances, marihuana or specified offense convictions\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill would repeal the sealing provision of the so-called\n\"Rockefeller Drug Law Reform\" enacted as a part of New York State's\n2009-2010 Budget, which allows criminal courts, on notice to the\nprosecutor, to seal the criminal records of felons upon their\nsuccessful completion of \"drug court,\" and would restore the ability\nof prospective employers to obtain accurate criminal background checks.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1: Repeals CPL 150.68 which authorizes\na criminal court on its own motion, or upon motion of the defendant,\nand on notice to the prosecutor, to seal all records of the current\nprosecution for Class B, C, D and E drug felonies, in addition to a\nnumber of non-drug offenses enumerated in CPL 410.91, if a defendant\nsuccessfully completes a \"diversion\" program, i.e., drug court. The\nsection to be repealed further allows the Court to seal up to three\nprevious drug misdemeanors in addition to the pending felony or\nfelonies.\nSection 2: Makes a conforming change to Executive Law 296.\nSection 3: Effective date - immediately\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe Legislature has authorized and required criminal\nbackground checks be conducted when persons apply for firearms\nlicenses or licenses to sell firearms. The Legislature has likewise\nprovided that prospective employers can check applicants' criminal\nhistories when they apply to be teachers, daycare and nursing home\nworkers, caregivers for the mentally disabled and caregivers in the\nhome, as well as for positions that require security clearance such\nas detectives, bank guards and armored car guards.\n\nThe expansive sealing provision enacted under the so-called\n\"Rockefeller Drug Law Reform,\" purportedly to give drug criminals\nwith up to four serious crimes on their records a clean slate,\neffectively insulates a whole class of criminals from this necessary\nscrutiny and thereby exposes to unwarranted risks vulnerable segments\nof our society, our children, our elderly, our bank tellers. In order\nto fulfill the\nLegislative purpose in allowing and mandating criminal background\nchecks, the recently enacted sealing provisions must be stricken.\n\nNotably, this legislation would have no effect on other sealing\nprovisions provided to youthful offenders or persons acquitted of\ncrimes or where the charges are adjourned in contemplation of\ndismissal.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.5684 of 2010 - Referred to Codes\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to the state.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
