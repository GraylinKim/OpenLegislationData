  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1322\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the election law, in relation to prohibiting election\ncommissioners and deputy elections commissioners from holding a publicly\nelected office\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill would prohibit election commissioners and deputy election\ncommissioners from holding an elected office or serving as\nchairperson of the respective democratic or republican party or\ncommittee in such county with the exception of notary public,\ncommissioner of deeds, member of a community board within the city of\nNew York or trustee of school officer outside of a city.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThis bill amends subdivision four of section 3-200 of the election law\nby adding deputy commissioner of elections to the section and\nstriking provisions within the section that allow a commissioner of\nelections to be a village officer, town judge, city judge or as\nchairperson of the respective democratic or republican party or\ncommittee in such county.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThis bill prohibits an election commissioner or deputy election\ncommissioner from serving as a village officer, town judge, city\njudge or as chairperson of the respective democratic or republican\nparty or committee in such county.\nCurrently under the statute exceptions are carved out allowing these\npurportedly non-partisan appointed representatives to run for elected\noffice in villages and as town and city judges. Under the current\nstatute, it is illogical for commissioners and deputy commissioners\nto serve as neutral referees of the electoral process while at the\nsame time being able to run on a particular political party ticket\nfor the elected positions carved out as exceptions in the statute or\nto serve as chairperson of the respective democratic or republican\nparty or committee in such county that works to elect candidates\nrunning on his/her party line. In addition, serious conflicts of\ninterest could arise in the event a commissioner did run for one of\nthe excepted positions in the statute only to have to turn around and\nrule on objections to petitions, the validity of absentee ballots,\naffidavit ballots, and eventually certify the race he or she ran for.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009/10 - S.1434A Passed Senate\n2007/08 - S.1505/A.6766 Referred to Elections\n2007/08 - A.6766  Referred to Election Law\n2005-06 - S.7860/A.10820 Referred to Election Law\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
