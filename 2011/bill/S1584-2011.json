  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1584\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the education law, in relation to establishment of a\nfacilitator center for private and parochial schools\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo establish a mechanism to more efficiently and effectively\nadminister federal, state and local education funds intended to\nbenefit the students and teachers in the state's independent and\nreligious schools and to promote, foster and encourage academic\nexcellence and scholastic achievement in such schools.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection one establishes the Facilitator Center for Independent and\nReligious Schools as a means by which such schools may choose to have\ntheir respective federal, state, and/or local education funds\nadministered.\n\nSection two establishes an immediate effective date\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nA number of state and federal education funding programs are designed\nto benefit all children and teachers regardless of whether they are\nin public or independent/religious schools. These include 12 of the\n16 title programs under the federal Elementary and Secondary\nEducation Act (ESEA) as well as the state's several instructional\nmaterial aid programs.\n\nIn most cases, however, these funds, including the funds intended to\nbenefit children and teachers in independent and religious schools,\nmust be administered in public schools, which further burdens public\nschool administrators with programs designed to benefit children for\nwhich they have no direct responsibility. Moreover, independent and\nreligious school\nadministrators often find it difficult to access such funds in an\nefficient, effective and timely manner.\n\nThe Regional Facilitator Center for Nonpublic Schools was established\nin the early 1980s to serve independent and religious schools\nthroughout the state. In addition to other services, the Facilitator\nCenter has served as a \"third party administrator\" for a number of\nthe federal education title program funds on behalf of groups of\nreligious and independent schools.\n\nCodifying the Facilitator Center in state law will enable the\nreligious and independent schools to choose to have their state\neducation funding programs administered by the Facilitator Center.\nThis will provide significant administrative relief for public school\ndistricts currently required to administer such programs and will\nenable religious and independent school administrators to access\nthese programs more effectively and efficiently for their students\nand teachers.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n\nS.5415 from 2009 - Referred to Education Committee\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to the state or public school districts.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
