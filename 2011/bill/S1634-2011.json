This act\nwill require the video and audio recording of the criminally accused\nduring custodial interrogations at police stations or other places of\ndetention.

To further this aspiration,\nthis act will require all custodial interrogations at police stations\nor other places of detention to be video recorded. By requiring the\nvideo recording of oral and written statements, the government will\nbe able to provide uncontroversial evidence of the validity of those\nstatements.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.2099 of 2007\n01/31/08 Referred to Codes\nS.110 of 2009\n01/07/09 Referred to Codes\n01/06110 Referred to Codes\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR ST ATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the first of November next succeeding\nthe date on which it shall have become a law and shall apply to\ncustodial interrogations occurring on or after such effective date.\n\n",
