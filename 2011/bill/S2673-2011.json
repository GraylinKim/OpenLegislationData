  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2673\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public authorities law, in relation to the imposition\nof tolls and surcharges for certain bridges and tunnels\n\nSUMMARY:\nThis legislation amends the public\nauthorities law by adding a new section 553-h-1\nto prohibit an increase in the toll surcharge on all\nbridges and tunnels operated by the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel\nAuthority (TBTA).\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nDuring these times of recession, an\nincrease in a\nsurcharge in tolls is forcing the middle class to leave the city. It\nis economically unwise to force the working people of the city, the\nbackbone of our economy to relocate. Furthermore, the increased tolls\n(tax) collected from these same people, would be used by the MTA. The\nMTA justifies this increase as a method to help rectify the budgetary\nproblems and prevent a fare increase. This argument avoids the real\nissue. The current apportionment of TBTA toll funds favors the\ncommuter rail lines which operate with a monetary surplus each year.\nThis allocation formula operates at the direct expense of the MTA\nsubways and buses which need the most work and operate at a financial\ndefeat. This situation is compounded in its unfairness by the fact\nthat most of these funds are used to support rail systems that\nprovide almost no service to city residents. Therefore, the real\nissue is the funding formula of excess TBTA tolls. This bill\nreallocates those funds and gives the NYC MTA its fair share, while\nholding back toll increases. Automobile owners already pay high\nregistration fees and taxes on gasoline in addition to the many taxes\nthey pay for the privilege of living in our\ncity. While these burdens increase, there seems to be no reciprocal\nincrease in available services. For many, mass transit is not a\nviable option, and they must rely on their cars. To increase tolls on\nthese facilities is unfair punishment to the middle class who\nregularly must bear the brunt of our government's failures. Levying\nunnecessary taxes on this group of New Yorkers will eventually lead\nthem to leave our city, further compounding our fiscal peril. The\ngovernment should work to reverse this trend, not to contribute to it.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
