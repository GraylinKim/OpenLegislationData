  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2045\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the general business law, in relation to spare tires for\nrental vehicles\n\nSUMMARY:\nThis bill amends &sect; 398-bb of the\ngeneral business law to require car rental companies to make available\nfull-sized spare tires.  Upon request, the car rental company must equip\na rental vehicle with a full-sized spare tire.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nCurrently, car rental companies are required to equip each rental\nvehicle with a small \"space saver\" tire which, if needed, can be\ninflated to fit the vehicle. \"Space saver\" tires are designed to\nfunction for 30-40 miles on the open road, at a rate of approximately\n45 m.p.h. Once beyond these prescribed limitations, it may become\nhazardous to operate the vehicle. This is neither convenient nor\npractical in many instances. Often vehicles are rented for use on\nlong-distance trips. In such a case, the vehicle may be driven on\nremote roads with few or no service stations readily accessible or,\nlate at night when service stations are not open for business. If a\nperson renting a vehicle is forced to use his \"space saver\" tire\nunder either of the above conditions, it is very possible that the\nindividual will be stranded and left to the mercy of a sympathetic\npasserby. This would result in lost travel time as well as a\npotentially dangerous situation. This bill would require rental\ncompanies to make available full-sized spare tires. In so doing, the\nrenter has the option of requesting a full-sized spare tire. This\nwould not impose an unduly harsh burden on rental companies given\nthat they are only required to make available full-sized spa\nres and must only equip such vehicle with said tire, upon request.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATION:\nMinimal cost to rental companies.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the ninetieth day next succeeding the\ndate on which it shall have become a law.\n\n",
