  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1393\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public authorities law, in relation to enacting the\n\"public benefits for professional facilities act\"\n\nPURPOSE:\nThe primary purpose of this bill is to provide an accounting\nof all benefits that any state or local authority has granted for the\npurpose of construction, reconstruction, repair, or rehabilitation of\na professional sports facility to the legislature, and to condition\nsuch benefits on an affordable ticket agreement.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection One: Title of bill.\n\nSection Two of the bill amends the public authorities law by adding a\nnew title 3-B, Section 2860 which requires that the Empire state\ndevelopment corporation shall publish on its website and provide to\nthe legislature an accounting of all benefits that any state or local\nauthority has granted or obligated itself to grant for the purpose of\nconstruction, reconstruction, repair, or rehabilitation of a\nprofessional sports facility and requires the Empire State\ndevelopment corporation to publish on its website and provide to the\nlegislature an update of such accounting by February fifteenth of\neach year. This section also requires state and local authorities to\ncondition any such benefit on an affordable ticket agreement\nrequiring the recipient of the benefit to offer seven percent of\ntickets sold to any sporting event at affordable prices and limits\nticket price increases, in certain circumstances, to no more than two\npercent annually for the next ten years. Affordable is defined by\nthis section as being within the economic ability of persons whose\nincome is at or below sixty percent of the area median income for a\nfour-person household. Section two also includes anti-scalping\nprovisions to prevent the resale of tickets subject to the\nagreement at prices above face value.\n\nSection Three: Sets forth the effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nPublic authorities often provide enormous subsidies\nfor construction, reconstruction, repair, or renovation of sports\nfacilities. The rationale for providing these subsidies is that the\nfacilities thus created and maintained provide a benefit to the\ngeneral public. While such benefit may take many forms the basic\npurpose of these facilities--serving as a venue for spectator\nsporting events--is often out of reach for New Yorkers with modest\nmeans. This bill would make affordable tickets a required part of the\npublic benefit we expect when we subsidize these projects.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-10:  S.5382 Referred to Corporations, Authorities & Commissions\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
