YOUNG  -- read twice and ordered printed, and when\n         printed to be committed to the Committee on Local Government\n\n       AN ACT to prohibit local assessors from increasing the assessed value of\n         real property based on the stumpage value of the trees thereon and  to\n         establish  the  forestland  taxation task force; and providing for the\n         repeal of such provisions upon the expiration thereof\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section  1.  Legislative  findings.  The  legislature hereby finds and\n    2  declares that in light of significant increases in real  property  taxes\n    3  in  many  parts  of the state, due to a variety of factors including but\n    4  not limited to increases in market value of  real  property,  growth  in\n    5  school  and  local  spending,  a declining commercial and industrial tax\n    6  base, and  assessment  valuation  practices  which  may  not  accurately\n    7  reflect  the actual value of timber, that now more than ever an increas-\n    8  ing proportion of lands in the state devoted to  the  growth  of  forest\n    9  crops  are assessed at a level which renders the continued dedication to\n   10  such use uneconomical. It is the purpose of this act to chart a path  by\n   11  which  present and future forestlands may be protected and enhanced as a\n   12  viable segment of the state's economy, and as an environmental resource.\n   13    S 2. On and after January 1, 2011, no assessor of any local  assessing\n   14  unit  shall  increase  that  portion  of the assessment of real property\n   15  which pertains to the stumpage value of trees on any parcel of privately\n   16  owned real property to which a stumpage value is assigned on the  effec-\n   17  tive  date of this act, as determined from the assessment from the imme-\n   18  diately preceding assessment roll.\n   19    S 3. Commencing with the 2011 assessment  roll,  an  assessor  of  any\n   20  local  assessing  unit shall assign a value for trees upon any parcel of\n   21  real property which does not bear a stumpage value immediately prior  to\n   22  the effective date of this act.\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD04087-01-1\n\n       S. 787                              2\n\n    1    S  4.  The  provisions of sections two and three of this act shall not\n    2  apply to state owned land.\n    3    S  5. As used in this act, \"stumpage value\" shall mean that portion of\n    4  privately owned forestland which is in addition to the bare  land  value\n    5  and  pertains  to real property upon which the assessor has calculated a\n    6  contributory value for the trees pursuant to guidelines  for  the  valu-\n    7  ation of forestlands issued by the office of real property services.\n    8    S  6.  A forestland taxation task force is hereby established to exam-\n    9  ine, evaluate and make recommendations concerning the  existing  methods\n   10  of  assessing and taxing private forestlands, and alternative methods of\n   11  assessing and taxing  private  forestlands  which  are  consistent  with\n   12  promoting sustainable forestry practices, encouraging private investment\n   13  in working forests and maintaining open space.\n   14    S  7. The forestland taxation task force shall consist of 7 members to\n   15  be appointed as follows: 2 shall be appointed by the temporary president\n   16  of the senate, 2 shall be appointed by the speaker of  the  assembly,  1\n   17  shall  be  appointed  by  the  minority leader of the senate, 1 shall be\n   18  appointed by the minority  leader  of  the  assembly,  and  1  shall  be\n   19  appointed by the governor. The members of the task force shall include a\n   20  representative  from  each  of  the following: family forest operations,\n   21  timber investment management organizations, farm woodlot  owners,  local\n   22  governments, the forest products industry, private forest landowners and\n   23  environmental  organizations.  Vacancies  in  the membership of the task\n   24  force shall be filled in the manner provided for original appointments.\n   25    S 8. The forestland taxation task force may meet  within  and  without\n   26  the state, shall hold public hearings and shall have all the powers of a\n   27  legislative  committee  pursuant  to the legislative law. To the maximum\n   28  extent feasible, the members of the task  force  shall  be  entitled  to\n   29  request and receive, and shall utilize and be provided with such facili-\n   30  ties,  resources  and  data  of  any court, department, division, board,\n   31  bureau, commission and agency of the state or any political  subdivision\n   32  thereof  as  it  may reasonably request to properly carry out its powers\n   33  and duties pursuant to this act.\n   34    S 9. The members of the forestland taxation task force  shall  receive\n   35  no  compensation  for  their services, but shall be allowed their actual\n   36  and necessary expenses incurred  in  the  performance  of  their  duties\n   37  pursuant to this act.\n   38    S 10. The forestland taxation task force shall report, to the governor\n   39  and the legislature, its findings, conclusions and recommendations on or\n   40  before April 30, 2012, and shall submit with its report such legislative\n   41  proposals as it deems necessary to implement its recommendations.\n   42    S  11.  This act shall take effect immediately and shall expire and be\n   43  deemed repealed May 1, 2012.\n",
