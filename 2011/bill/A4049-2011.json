ENGLEBRIGHT -- read once and referred to the\n         Committee on Insurance\n\n       AN ACT to amend the insurance law, in relation to creating a task  force\n         on universal long term care insurance\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature finds  and\n    2  declares  that  the  average  length  of life is increasing and that the\n    3  population as a whole is aging. The age sixty-five  plus  population  is\n    4  expected  to  more than double between the years 2000 and 2030 to number\n    5  almost seventy million nationally. Sixty percent of those who reach  age\n    6  sixty-five  will  need some form of long term care. In comparison to the\n    7  state's total population increase of five and one-half  percent  between\n    8  the  years  1990 and 2000, the number of individuals age eighty-five and\n    9  older increased by twenty-five and one-half percent and is  the  fastest\n   10  growing  segment of our population. Dynamic changes in the state's popu-\n   11  lation will continue to increase as the baby boom generation reaches age\n   12  sixty and continues to mature. As one would anticipate from these shifts\n   13  in demographics, the need for affordable  long  term  care  services  is\n   14  growing and is expected to accelerate at a dramatic rate.\n   15    In New York state, the average yearly cost of a nursing home can range\n   16  from  seventy  thousand dollars to one hundred fifteen thousand dollars.\n   17  Twenty-four hour home health care can cost more than  twice  this  much.\n   18  Many  New  Yorkers  are unable to afford the high cost of long term care\n   19  insurance and must rely on Medicaid to pay for the costs of home  health\n   20  or nursing home care.\n   21    Congress  recognized  the  public  benefit of social insurance when it\n   22  implemented Social Security in order to better  the  condition  of  each\n   23  American  at  his  or her retirement and thereafter. Under its constitu-\n   24  tion, the state has an obligation to promote the general welfare of  its\n   25  citizens by enabling them to access the care they will need in their old\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD02571-01-1\n\n       A. 4049                             2\n\n    1  age without having to impoverish themselves. This act is a reflection of\n    2  state  concern  for the lack of alternatives to Medicaid that are avail-\n    3  able to the citizens of New York in order to  finance  the  astronomical\n    4  costs  of  long  term care. Accordingly, it charges the governor and the\n    5  legislature with the responsibility of creating a plan that would estab-\n    6  lish a system of mandatory long term care insurance for all New Yorkers.\n    7  This approach, premised  on  the  principle  of  universal  coverage  in\n    8  exchange  for  universal responsibility, will ensure that every resident\n    9  of the state receives the protection of long term care  insurance  bene-\n   10  fits in his or her old age.\n   11    S  2.  The  insurance law is amended by adding a new section 1117-a to\n   12  read as follows:\n   13    S 1117-A. TASK FORCE  ON  UNIVERSAL  LONG  TERM  CARE  INSURANCE.  (A)\n   14  CREATION.
