  "fulltext" : "\nLEGISLATIVE  RESOLUTION commemorating the 30th Anniversary of the ending\nof the Iranian Hostage Crisis on January 20, 2011\n\nWHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to seek  peace,  with\nthe  imperishable hope of freedom for all the Nations and peoples of the\nworld; and\n  WHEREAS, New York State remains committed to bringing to  justice  all\nperpetrators of terrorism; and\n  WHEREAS,  It  is  the sense of this Legislative Body, representing the\npeople of the State of New York, to commemorate the 30th Anniversary  of\nthe ending of the Iranian Hostage Crisis on January 20, 2011; and\n  WHEREAS, In early 1979, conditions in Iran had started to deteriorate;\nvarious factions were fighting to oust the Shah of Iran from power; and\n  WHEREAS,  On  January  16th,  Muhammad  Reza Pahlevi, the Shah of Iran\nwhose regime had the support of the  United  States,  announced  he  was\ntaking a short vacation; a new government had been formed to replace his\nmilitary administration; and\n  WHEREAS,  The main opposition force, headed by the Ayatollah Khomeini,\nhowever, refused to join or cooperate with the new government; and\n  WHEREAS, Muhammad Reza Pahlevi then fled into  exile  but  was  denied\nadmission  into  the  United  States  and  subsequently,  he temporarily\nsettled in Egypt; and\n  WHEREAS, Weeks later,  revolutionaries  loyal  to  Ayatollah  Khomeini\nseized 70 employees at the United States embassy in Tehran and held them\nhostage  for  several  hours  to  protest  American involvement with the\nShah's regime; and\n  WHEREAS, As conditions in the Iranian capital grew more  chaotic,  the\nUnited  States government evacuated families of embassy personnel; other\nAmericans still in the country were urged to leave Iran immediately; and\n  WHEREAS, On October 22, 1979, Muhammad Reza  Pahlevi  was  allowed  to\nenter  the United States for gall-bladder surgery, prompting a new round\nof protest in Iran; and\n  WHEREAS, On November 4, 1979, thousands  of  students,  demanding  the\nreturn  of the Shah, overran the United States embassy and held approxi-\nmately 90 people captive; later, some were freed,  including  women  and\nnon-Americans as well as Americans of African descent; and\n  WHEREAS,  As  diplomatic efforts to free the hostages began, President\nJimmy Carter halted oil imports from Iran and froze  Iranian  assets  in\nthe  United  States,  prompting  yet another Iranian outburst of protest\nagainst America; and\n  WHEREAS, As negotiations continued into  December,  Penelope  Laingen,\nthe  wife  of  hostage  Bruce Laingen, charge d'affaires of the embassy,\ntied a yellow ribbon around a tree  at  her  home  in  Maryland,  and  a\nnationwide movement began; and\n  WHEREAS, Millions of Americans also tied the yellow symbols of freedom\naround  trees  in  their  yards;  these luminous symbols remained on the\ntrees until the hostages came home, more than a year later; and\n  WHEREAS, A frustrated President Carter  severed  diplomatic  relations\nwith  Iran and imposed a complete economic embargo with Iran in April of\n1980; and\n  WHEREAS, On April 24th, Operation Eagle Claw, a top-secret mission  to\nfree  the hostages, ended in disaster; at the outset of the operation, a\nhelicopter developed engine trouble in a staging  area  of  the  Iranian\ndesert;  eight  Americans  were killed as two planes collided during the\nsubsequent withdrawal of United States forces; and\n  WHEREAS, Even the death of the Shah  in  July  did  not  persuade  the\nAyatollah and the students to free the hostages; and\n\n  WHEREAS, Iraq invaded Iran on September 22, 1980, and a full-scale war\nensued  between  the  two nations, causing further problems with negoti-\nations on the hostages; and\n  WHEREAS,  The  hostage  crisis played a major role in the presidential\ncampaign of 1980; Ronald Reagan won the presidential election on  Novem-\nber 4, 1980; and\n  WHEREAS,  Perhaps  fearing  the new incoming administration, Iran then\nbegan new negotiations to free the hostages; Iranians  originally  asked\nfor $24 billion in return for the captives, but eventually lowered their\ndemands; and\n  WHEREAS,  On Inauguration Day, January 20, 1981, Iran agreed to accept\n$8 billion in frozen assets and a promise by the United States  to  lift\ntrade sanctions in exchange for the release of the hostages; and\n  WHEREAS,  After  444  days  in  captivity, the 52 hostages flew out of\nTehran to the Wiesbaden Air Force Base in West Germany; the announcement\nwas made minutes after Ronald Reagan was sworn in as the 40th  President\nof the United States of America; and\n  WHEREAS,  On  January 21, 1981, former President Carter, who had hoped\nto greet the hostages as his last official act, flew to West Germany  as\nPresident  Reagan's  emissary  to  greet  each  and  every  one  of them\npersonally; now, therefore, be it\n  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause  in  its  deliberations  to\ncommemorate  the  30th  Anniversary of the ending of the Iranian Hostage\nCrisis on January 20, 2011; and be it further\n  RESOLVED, That copies of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be tran-\nsmitted to the 52 former hostages and their families.\n",
