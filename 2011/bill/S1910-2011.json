Under this section, the New York State Department of\nTaxation and Finance is authorized to seek reimbursement from IDA's\nfor supposed state costs attributable to our IDA's.\n\nOften times, the IDA is one of the only economic development tools\nthat counties have to offer companies that are looking to expand or\nrelocate here. So, for the state to begin assessing charges on IDA's\nwould harm their ability to promote economic development and tax base\nexpansion. To that end, this bill recognizes that by repealing this\nunneeded fee on economic development.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.6962A of 2009-2010\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nSection 2975-a allows for recovery from IDA's of\nup to $5 million.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately, with provisions.\n\n",
