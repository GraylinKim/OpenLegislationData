There  is hereby imposed and shall be paid a tax on all cigarettes\n    5  possessed in the state by any person for sale, except that no tax  shall\n    6  be  imposed  on cigarettes sold under such circumstances that this state\n    7  is without power to impose such tax, including sales to qualified  Indi-\n    8  ans for their own use and consumption on their nations' or tribes' qual-\n    9  ified  reservation,  or  sold  to  the  United States or sold to or by a\n   10  voluntary unincorporated organization of the armed forces of the  United\n   11  States  operating  a place for the sale of goods pursuant to regulations\n   12  promulgated by the appropriate executive agency of the United States, to\n   13  the extent provided in such regulations and policy statements of such an\n   14  agency applicable to such sales.

  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2008\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the tax law, in relation to taxes on cigarettes sold on an\nIndian reservation to non-members of the Indian nation or tribe\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill temporarily suspends the $1.60 cigarette tax increase until\nthe state begins collecting taxes on cigarettes sold on an Indian\nReservation to non-members of the Indian Nation or Tribe.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nAmends section 471 of the Tax Law by adding language to temporarily\nsuspend the $1.60 cigarette tax increase until the state begins\ncollecting taxes on cigarettes sold on an Indian Reservation to\nnon-members of the Indian Nation or Tribe. If the state fails to\ncollect the tax, this bill would impose the cigarette tax at $2.75;\nonce the state begins collecting, the cigarette tax rate would be\nimposed at $4.35.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nChapter 134 of the Laws of 2010 (Emergency Spending Bill), raised\nvarious taxes, including a $1.60 cigarette tax increase beginning\nJuly 1, 2010, and set a firm deadline of September 1, 2010 to begin\ncollecting taxes on cigarettes sold on an Indian Reservation to\nnon-members of the Indian Nation or Tribe. On July 1st, the cigarette\ntax increase went into effect. However, on the September 1st deadline\nto collect taxes on cigarettes sold on an Indian Reservation to\nnon-members of the Indian Nation or Tribe, Indian nations filed suits\nin state and federal courts. The courts responded by temporarily\nhalting the September 1st collection date.\nThe current cigarette tax increase and the subsequent failure of the\nState to collect taxes has only widened the gap of inequality between\nretailers and Indian nation sellers. It is not fair to uphold one\npart of Chapter 134 of the Laws of 2010 and yet temporarily halt\nanother part of the law. Consequently, this bill aims to uphold\nfairness by temporarily suspending the $1.60 cigarette tax increase\nuntil the State begins collecting taxes on cigarettes sold on an\nIndian Reservation to non-members of the Indian Nation or tribe.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010: S.8496 - Rules Committee; A.11720 - Ways and Means\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nThe fiscal impact is dependent upon the State collecting taxes on\ncigarettes sold on an Indian Reservation to non-members of the Indian\nNation or tribe. The 2010-11 State fiscal year financial plan assumes\nthe collection of $114 million in taxes from Indian reservation sales\nto non-Indians and $260 million in additional revenue from the\nincrease in the excise tax of $1.60 per pack of 20 cigarettes.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediate.\n\n",
