  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2145\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public health law, in relation\nto establishing an\nalternative benefits demonstration program and creating health\nopportunity accounts\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1. Creates a new Title 5-B of the\nelder law to create the Interagency\ndemonstration acts office, to examine and make recommendations with\nrespect to opportunities to create demonstration programs under\nfederal waivers. Members include the director of the office of aging,\nthe commissioner of the department of health, and the commissioner of\nthe office of temporary and disability assistance.\n\nSection 2 - Effective Date\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe DRA requires the Secretary of HHS to establish a demonstration\nprogram under which up to 10 states may provide under their\nMedicaid programs (including a plan operating under a statewide\n1115 waiver) for qualified alternative benefits (a high deductible\nplan and a health opportunity account (HOA) for eligible population\ngroups in one or more areas of the state. Demonstrations would\nbegin January 1, 2007.\nSecretarial approval of a demonstration would be conditioned upon the\ndemonstration meeting specified criteria, including providing\nincentives for preventive services and access to negotiated provider\npayment rates.\n\nThe approach incorporates key components of health savings accounts\n(HSAs) authorized in the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) into a\nnew Medicaid demonstration pilot. Under the pilot, states could\nallow participating beneficiaries to self-direct\na pre-funded account for medical care, rollover unspent\nbalances, and retain a portion of account funds after leaving\nMedicaid to spend on medical care, health insurance, job training and\ntuition expenses.\n\nAllow demonstrations in three to ten counties, which participate\nvoluntarily, under which:\n\n* The persons eligible would be working poor who are eligible for\nMedicaid or other similar programs, e.g., Family Health Plus\n(mandatory exclusion of individuals age 65 or older, or who are\ndisabled. pregnant, or receiving terminal care or long-term care.\n* Participation would be voluntary.\n* Participants can spend their accounts on services they choose.\n\n* Annual deductibles would be 110% of the annualized amount of\ncontributions to the HOA.\n* The state would provide the maximum contribution of $4,500 ($2,500\nfor the parent and $1,000 for each of the children) to the family's\nHealth Opportunity Account. The deductible would be set at the\nmaximum level: $4,950 (110 percent of the state's contribution).\n* When spending reaches the deductible, standard Medicaid kicks in,\ni.e., standard Medicaid coverage kicks in when the family reaches the\n$4,950 expenditure point.\n* Beneficiaries keep remaining balances when they are no longer\neligible for Medicaid.\n* An advisory committee helps in implementation.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.6987 of 2006 - Aging, Finance\nS.156  of 2008 - Aging\nS.1570 of 2010 - Aging\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined, however, the federal cost in 2007 is estimated by CBO\nat $10 million,\nexpanding to $15 million in 2008, 2009 and reaching $25 million by\n2011. State costs based on this fiscal would be minimal, if any.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
