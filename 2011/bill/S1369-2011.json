  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1369\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the highway law,\nin relation to authorizing county highway superintendents to rent road\nmachinery from any city, town or village, and\nthe authority of the town highway\nsuperintendent to contract with another municipality, district\ncorporation, school district, community college or any unit of the state\nuniversity to provide certain services and the use of town machinery,\ntools and equipment\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo remove limitations upon the county\nhighway superintendents\nto rent road machinery, and town highway superintendents to, upon\nboard approval, contract with a municipality, district, district\ncorporation, school district, community college or unit of the state\nuniversity.\nUnder the present law county highway superintendents may contract with\nentities within the particular county and, a town highway\nsuperintendent, upon board approval, may contract with such entities\nproviding they are located in the town. This bill would remove such\nlimitation on shared services and permit contracting with such\ngovernment entities for shared services even if not located in the\ncounty or the town. The removal of this limitation makes the highway\nlaw consistent with Article 5-G of the General Municipal law\ngoverning shared services arrangements in local governments.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThe present provisions of &sect; 117 and &sect; 142 of\nthe highway law permit a county highway superintendent to rent road\nmachinery to an entity within the county and a town superintendent of\nhighways, upon town board approval, to contract with a village for\nthe removal of snow and ice from streets and the repair of sidewalks,\nproviding the village is located within the town. This bill\nauthorizes such superintendents of highways to contract with any\nentity for such machinery or work whether the entity is located in\nthe county or town or in any other county or town.\n\nSection 142-d of the highway law further restricts the town highway\nsuperintendent's authority to contract by not permitting contracts\nwith villages located outside the town, the section, nevertheless,\npermits such contracts for the use of town highway machinery, snow\nand ice removal equipment, tools and equipment by any county or\nmunicipality, district, district corporation, school district,\ncommunity college and any unite of the state university. This bill\nremoves such restriction and permits the town highway superintendent\nto contract with any village whether such village is located in or\noutside the town.\n\nSection 142-b of the highway law is amended to remove the restriction\nnow placed upon the town superintendent of highways which permits such\nsuperintendent upon town board approval only to contract to repair\nroads and sidewalks on property of a school district ~f such school\ndistrict is located in the town. The bill provides that such\ncontracts can be entered into whether the property of the school\ndistrict is located in the town or not. The amendments permit the\ntown highway superintendent to contract with any fire district,\nspecial improvement district or school district for the use of town\nhighway machinery, tools and equipment. The present law restricts\nsuch superintendent to contract only with those fire districts,\nspecial improvement districts or school districts that are located\nwithin the town.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThere is no justification for the restrictions now\nimposed in the law. Smart growth anticipates the expansion of\nintermunicipal cooperation. This bill is an attempt to further\nencourage the full use of county and town highway machinery and\nequipment all to the benefit of the taxpayers of the state. It should\nbe further noted that article 5G of the general municipal law (\n119-m through 119-000) is a broad grant of power granted to\nmunicipalities to contract among themselves in providing certain\nservices. This bill is consistent with that article but also relates\nto community colleges and units of the state university. This bill\nplus article 5-G are consistent and are designed to further the goals\nof intermunicipal cooperation\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-10:  S.5426/A.7834\n2007-08:  S.3237/A.5209\n2005-06:  S.2616/A.5484A\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nThe bill has no direct fiscal implication for the\nstate except that contracts with units of the state university and\ntowns may be encouraged. Contracts with a town and a unit of the\nstate university could have the effect of reducing some costs of\noperation of such unit of the state university.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThe bill takes effect immediately.\n\n",
