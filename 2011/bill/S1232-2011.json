  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1232\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the civil rights law, in relation to exemptions provided to\nprofessional journalists and newscasters from contempt\n\nPURPOSE:\nExpands the exemption provided to professional journalists\nand newscasters from contempt to include employment or association\nwith a web log (blog).\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection One of the bill amends paragraph 6\nof subdivision (a) of section 79-h of the civil rights to include\n\"web log\" as a medium that can be used by a \"professional journalist.\"\n\nSection Two of the bill amends subdivision (a) of section 79-h of the\ncivil rights law by adding a new paragraph 9 to define \"web log\" as a\nwebsite or webpage that contains an online journal containing news,\ncomments and offers hyperlinks provided by the professional\njournalist or newscaster.\n\nSection Three amends subdivision (b) of section 79-h of the civil\nrights law to include \"web log\" as a medium that a professional\njournalist and newscasters may use to receive protection for\nconfidential news and receive exemption from contempt.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nNew bill.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nCurrently, professional journalists involved with\nnewspapers, magazines, news agencies, press associations, wire\nservices, radio or television are protected from being charged with\ncontempt of court for failing to disclose any news obtained in\nconfidence or failing to provide the identity of a confidential source.\n\nNew York has a proud tradition of having one of the strongest\nreporter's shield laws in the country. Yet, in 2011, New York law\ndoes not provide protections to journalist bloggers - one of the\nfastest growing mediums for obtaining news. This glaring omission\nmust not be allowed to continue.\n\nA grand jury subpoena issued by the Bronx District Attorney was sent\nto the blog Room 8 in an attempt to identify people blogging\nanonymously on the website. The subpoena threatened the bloggers not\nto disclose the existence of the subpoena - or face possible jail\ntime. The subpoena was eventually withdrawn.\n\nIf legislation is not enacted, there will be more cases of journalist\nbloggers facing contempt charges and jail time. This will have a\nchilling effect on free speech and a blogger's ability to\naggressively report the news. It is time New York's shield law\nreflected the reality of 2011 and acknowledge that blogs do exist.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2008: S.8746 (Duane), Died in Rules\n2009: S.4642 (Duane), Died in Rules; A.6078 (Rosenthal), Died in\nGoverment Operations\n2010: S.4662 (Duane), Died on 3rd Reading; A.6078 (Rosenthal), Died in\nGovernment Operations\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
