  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2665\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the real property tax law, in relation to tax exemptions for\nmembers of certain\nvolunteer fire companies and departments on\nFire Island\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo grant a 10% real property tax exemption on seasonal residences to\nmembers of certain volunteer fire companies and departments on Fire\nIsland.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 and 2 of the bill amends paragraphs (a) and (b) of\nsubdivision 2 of section 466-c of the real property tax law to allow\nseasonal residents who are members of certain fire districts and\ndepartments located on Fire Island to receive a 10% real property tax\nexemption.\n\nSection 3 of the bill amends subdivision 3 of section 466-c of the\nreal property tax law to allow seasonal residents of Fire Island who\naccrue more than 20 years of active service as enrolled members of\ncertain fire departments and districts a permanent 10% real property\ntax exemption for so long as such person maintains his or her\nseasonal residence. This exemption is contingent upon the town of\nIslip and Brookhaven adopting a local law, ordinance or resolution\nauthorizing same.\n\nSection 4 of the bill provides for the effective date.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nCurrent law authorizes a 10% real property tax exemption for volunteer\nfirefighters and volunteer ambulance workers who maintain a primary\nresidency in the area which is served by such volunteer fire company\nor fire department or incorporated volunteer ambulance service.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nVolunteer firefighters are an important and devoted asset to local\ncommunities. In recognition of their importance, the state\nlegislature passed laws that would allow localities to grant a 10%\nreal property tax exemption to certified enrolled members of an\nincorporated volunteer fire company, fire department or incorporated\nvolunteer ambulance service when their primary residence is located\nin the community they serve. On Fire Island, a unique situation\nexists where many of the volunteer firefighters who sacrifice their\ntime and energy\nto serve the needs of the community are seasonal residents. Thus, many\nof the Fire Island volunteer firefighters do not qualify for the same\nreal property tax exemption that the permanent resident firefighters\n\nreceive. This bill would allow those dedicated volunteer firefighters\nwho own a summer home on Fire Island and who have served the\ncommunity as a firefighter for at least five years to receive a 10%\nreal property tax exemption.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2007-08: S.5448 - Referred to Local Government\n2009-10: S.4411 - Referred to Local Government\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to State.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
