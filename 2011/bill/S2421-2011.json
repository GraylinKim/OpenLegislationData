  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2421\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the military law and the election law, in relation to the\ncounting of ballots of deceased military personnel\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill would require that absentee or military ballots of any\nactive duty service member be counted even if such service member\ndies before the date of the election for which it was cast.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nSpecifically, this bill would add a new section 234 of the military\nlaw, and a new section 8-413 of the election law, to provide that any\nmember of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, Army\nReserve, Naval Reserve, Marine Reserve, Air Force Reserve, National\nGuard, New York Army National Guard, New York Air National Guard, New\nYork Guard or Naval Militia, who casts an absentee or military ballot\nwhile on active duty, shall have such ballot be counted, even in the\nevent that such service member dies before the date of the scheduled\nelection on which it was cast.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nPresently, pursuant to New York State Law, if any voter casts an\nabsentee or military ballot, and is killed before the date of the\nelection for which it was cast, such ballot is deemed invalid and is\nnot counted. This is due to the reasoning that such person, who is\nvoting by means of such ballot, would not be able to actually vote in\nperson at the polls, due to the fact that they would have predeceased\nthe election. Such rule seeks to prevent voter fraud that could\noccurring from the casting of ballots of deceased voters.\n\nAlthough this law is generally a good public policy, an exception to\nthis rule needs to be made for active duty service members. For any\nactive duty service member, who makes the ultimate sacrifice in\ndefense of our freedom, should not be denied in death, their final\nact as a citizen of our great country. In such a case, there is no\nincentive or propensity for fraud. To fail to do so, to deny that\nright, to someone who has died in the service to both New York and\nthe United States, would be both unseemly and unconscionable. As a\nresult, a grateful nation should do no less to honor the memory of\nthat service member, than to count their duly and properly cast vote.\nThis bill would do just that.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2008: S.6493 - Reported to Rules.\n\nBUDGET IMPLICATIONS:\nNone noted.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act would take effect immediately.\n\n",
