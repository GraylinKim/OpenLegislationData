THE\n    3  EFFECTIVENESS OF THE NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SHALL BE MEASURED BY THE\n    4  NUTRIENT  UPTAKE  IN  THE  SOLID  PORTION OF MANURE SOLIDS, THE NUTRIENT\n    5  LEVELS IN THE LIQUID PORTION AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CREATING  A  CLEAN\n    6  WATER  DISCHARGE.

FOR PURPOSES\n   18  OF THIS SECTION, A \"NUTRIENT EXCHANGE\" IS DEFINED  AS  THE  USE  OF  THE\n   19  SOLID  PORTION  OF NUTRIENTS FOR A NON-AGRICULTURAL USE AS A SOIL CONDI-\n   20  TIONER. THE SOLIDS SHALL BE  MEASURED  FOR  EFFECTIVENESS  AND  ECONOMIC\n   21  VIABILITY  ON TURF AREAS AS A SOIL CONDITIONER. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE\n   22  SOLIDS SHALL BE MEASURED FOR GROWTH POTENTIAL, NUTRIENT LEACHING PROPER-\n   23  TIES, DISEASE SUPPRESSION AND THATCH DECOMPOSITION. THE ECONOMIC VIABIL-\n   24  ITY OF THE SOLIDS AS A SOIL CONDITIONER SHALL BE MEASURED BY  PER  CUBIC\n   25  YARD COST AND FREIGHT COST.\n   26    3.  THE BOARD SHALL APPOINT A NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT SPECIALIST TO ASSIST\n   27  CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FARMING OPERATION  REGULATED  FARMS  THROUGHOUT  THE\n   28  STATE WITH THE COMPLIANCE WITH THE CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FARMING OPERATION\n   29  REGULATIONS.
