  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S817             REVISED 01/13/2011\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the tax law, in relation to establishing a\nresidential fuel oil storage tank credit\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nEstablishes a tax credit for the removal or permanent enclosure of a\nresidential fuel oil storage tank credit.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nSection 606 of the tax law is amended by adding a new subsection (P-1).\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nThis legislation would reinstate a residential fuel oil storage tank\ncredit that was originally established by Section 3 of Part C of\nChapter 85 of the Laws of 2002. It would provide taxpayers with a tax\ncredit equal to the costs of removal or permanent closure of an\nexisting unprotected below-ground or aboveground residential fuel oil\nstorage tank used to provide heating fuel for single to four family\nresidences located in new York not to exceed five hundred dollars.\nThe credit would be allowed once per residence and may be carried\nforward to the following year or years and may be deducted from the\ntaxpayer's tax for such year or years.\n\nThe original residential fuel oil storage tank credit was a successful\nmechanism to get New Yorkers to replace and close underground oil\ntanks. Undoubtedly. individuals who did not act to remove these tanks\nbefore the program's expiration in 2003 are experiencing further\ncorrosion as their tanks continue to age. This legislation would give\nNew Yorkers another opportunity to take advantage of this incentive\nto protect their homes and the environment from the risk of\ncontamination by an existing unprotected or neglected below ground or\nabove ground residential fuel oil storage tank\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n2009-10 S.236/A.32; 2007-08, S.146/A.184; 2005-06, S.3144-A/A.4609A.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis act shall take effect on the first of January next succeeding the\ndate on which it shall have become law and shall apply to taxable\nyears beginning after such date.\n\n\n",
