GIBSON, JAFFEE, CASTRO, SPANO, ROBINSON, BARRON\n         -- Multi-Sponsored by -- M. of A. CRESPO,  DESTITO,  LIFTON,  McENENY,\n         PERRY,  PHEFFER,  ROSENTHAL -- read once and referred to the Committee\n         on Health\n\n       AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation to the  lupus  educa-\n         tion and outreach program; and making an appropriation therefor\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  the\n    2  following:\n    3    (a)  Lupus is a serious, complex, debilitating autoimmune disease that\n    4  can cause inflammation and tissue damage to virtually any  organ  system\n    5  in  the body, including the skin, joints, other connective tissue, blood\n    6  and blood vessels, heart, lungs, kidney, and brain.\n    7    (b) Lupus research estimates that approximately one and a half to  two\n    8  million Americans live with some form of lupus; lupus affects women nine\n    9  times more often than men and eighty percent of newly diagnosed cases of\n   10  lupus develop among women of childbearing age.\n   11    (c)  Lupus  disproportionately  affects women of color -- it is two to\n   12  three times more common among African-Americans, Hispanics,  Asians  and\n   13  Native Americans and is generally more prevalent in minority populations\n   14  -- a health disparity that remains unexplained. According to the Centers\n   15  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  the  rate of lupus mortality has\n   16  increased since the late 1970s and is higher among older  African-Ameri-\n   17  can women.\n   18    (d) No new drugs have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis-\n   19  tration  specifically  for lupus in nearly forty years and while current\n   20  treatments for the disease can be effective, they can lead  to  damaging\n   21  side effects.\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD00216-01-1\n\n       A. 457                              2\n\n    1    (e)  The  pain and fatigue associated with lupus can threaten people's\n    2  ability to live independently, make it difficult to maintain  employment\n    3  and  lead normal lives, and one in five people with lupus is disabled by\n    4  the disease, and consequently receives support from government programs,\n    5  including  Medicare,  Medicaid,  social  security disability, and social\n    6  security supplemental income.\n    7    (f) The estimated average annual cost  of  medical  treatment  for  an\n    8  individual  with lupus can range between ten thousand dollars and thirty\n    9  thousand dollars; for people who have the most serious  form  of  lupus,\n   10  medical  costs  can  greatly  exceed  this amount, causing a significant\n   11  economic, emotional and social burden to the entire family and society.\n   12    (g) More than half of the people with lupus suffer four or more  years\n   13  and  visit  three  or  more  physicians  before obtaining a diagnosis of\n   14  lupus; early diagnosis of and commencement of treatment  for  lupus  can\n   15  prevent or reduce serious organ damage, disability, and death.\n   16    (h)  Despite  the magnitude of lupus and its impact on individuals and\n   17  families, health professional and public understanding of lupus  remains\n   18  low; only one of five Americans can provide even basic information about\n   19  lupus,  and  awareness  of lupus is lowest among adults ages eighteen to\n   20  thirty-four -- the age group most likely to develop symptoms of lupus.\n   21    (i) Lupus is a significant  national  health  issue  that  deserves  a\n   22  comprehensive  and coordinated response by state and federal governments\n   23  with involvement of the health care provider, patient, and public health\n   24  communities.\n   25    S 2. Subdivision 1 of section 207 of the public health law is  amended\n   26  by adding a new paragraph (i) to read as follows:\n   27    (I)  LUPUS, A DEBILITATING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE THAT CAN CAUSE INFLAMMA-\n   28  TION AND TISSUE DAMAGE TO  VIRTUALLY  ANY  ORGAN  SYSTEM  IN  THE  BODY,\n   29  INCLUDING  THE  SKIN,  JOINTS,  OTHER CONNECTIVE TISSUE, BLOOD AND BLOOD\n   30  VESSELS, HEART, LUNG, KIDNEY AND BRAIN, AND WHICH AFFECTS WOMEN, PARTIC-\n   31  ULARLY WOMEN OF COLOR, IN A DISPROPORTIONATE MANNER; PROVIDED  THAT  THE\n   32  PROGRAM  SHALL INCLUDE AN ADVISORY COUNCIL UNDER THIS SECTION THAT SHALL\n   33  INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES OF PEOPLE WITH  LUPUS  AND  THEIR  FAMILIES  AND\n   34  HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHO SPECIALIZE IN TREATING LUPUS, AMONG OTHERS.\n   35    S 3. Subdivision 7 of section 207 of the public health law, as amended\n   36  by  section  16 of Part A of chapter 109 of the laws of 2010, is amended\n   37  to read as follows:\n   38    7. In addition to state funds appropriated  for  programs  under  this\n   39  section,  the  commissioner  may  accept  grants  from public or private\n   40  sources for these programs.  The  commissioner,  in  administering  this\n   41  section,  shall  seek to coordinate the department's programs with other\n   42  public and private programs, and  may  undertake  joint  or  cooperative\n   43  programs  with other public or private entities, INCLUDING MAKING GRANTS\n   44  (WITHIN AMOUNTS APPROPRIATED THEREFOR  AND  CONSISTENT  WITH  APPLICABLE\n   45  LAW) TO PUBLIC OR NOT-FOR-PROFIT ENTITIES.\n   46    S  4.  The sum of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00), or\n   47  so much thereof as may be  necessary,  is  hereby  appropriated  to  the\n   48  department  of  health  out  of  any moneys in the state treasury in the\n   49  general fund to the credit of the state purposes account, not  otherwise\n   50  appropriated,  and made immediately available, for the purpose of carry-\n   51  ing out the provisions of this act. Such moneys shall be payable on  the\n   52  audit  and  warrant of the comptroller on vouchers certified or approved\n   53  by the commissioner of health in the manner prescribed by law.\n   54    S 5. This act shall take effect immediately.\n",
