  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2548\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public officers law, in relation to financial disclosure by\nthe temporary president of the senate and the speaker of the assembly\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nTo require broader disclosure of the outside income of the Speaker of\nthe Assembly and Temporary President of the Senate.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nRequires the Speaker and Temporary President, in addition to filing\nany other information on their ethics disclosure forms to specify the\namount and source of income they received and the nature of the\nservices rendered or goods sold associated with that income. The bill\nalso maintains existing privileges where a individual or entity (ie.\nattorney/client privilege) has a right not to have their name\ndisclosed.\n\nEFFECTS OF PRESENT LAW WHICH THIS BILL WOULD ALTER:\nPresently the Speaker of the Assembly and Temporary President of the\nSenate are required to disclose outside income in only broad\ncategories.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe Brennan Center has pointed out that the Legislative Leadership has\na \"stranglehold\" on bills which reach the floor for a vote. People\nhave a clear right to know what payments are being made to leaders\nwith such power.\n\nDisclosure of actual income, rather than broad based categories,\nparticularly by the legislative leadership who have \"a stranglehold\non the flow of legislation at all stages of the legislative process\"\n(quoting the Brennan Center's January 2, 2009 report), is a more than\nreasonable reform which the State can make to help again give people\nconfidence in their government.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.2597 of 2009: Referred to Finance\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately and apply to any filing made for calendar year 2012 or\nlater.\n\n",
