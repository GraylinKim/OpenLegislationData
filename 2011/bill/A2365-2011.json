Paragraph (f) of subdivision 12 of section 66 of the public\n    2  service  law,  as amended by chapter 154 of the laws of 1989, is amended\n    3  to read as follows:\n    4    (f) Whenever there shall be filed with the commission by  any  utility\n    5  any  schedule stating a new rate or charge, or any change in any form of\n    6  contract or agreement or any rule or regulation relating  to  any  rate,\n    7  charge  or service, or in any general privilege or facility, the commis-\n    8  sion may, at any time within sixty days from the date when such schedule\n    9  would or has become effective, either upon complaint  or  upon  its  own\n   10  initiative,  and, if it so orders, without answer or other formal plead-\n   11  ing by the utility, but upon reasonable notice, hold a hearing  concern-\n   12  ing  the propriety of a change proposed by the filing.

Pending  such\n   14  hearing  and  decision  thereon,  the  commission, upon filing with such\n   15  schedule and delivering to the utility, a statement in  writing  of  its\n   16  reasons  therefor,  may  suspend the operation of such schedule, but not\n   17  for a longer period than one hundred and twenty  days  beyond  the  time\n   18  when  it  would  otherwise  go  into effect. After full hearing, whether\n   19  completed before or after the schedule goes into effect, the  commission\n   20  may  make  such  order  in  reference  thereto  as  would be proper in a\n   21  proceeding begun after the rate, charge, form of contract or  agreement,\n   22  rule,  regulation,  service,  general  privilege  or facility had become\n   23  effective. If any such hearing cannot be concluded within the period  of\n   24  suspension as above stated, the commission may extend the suspension for\n   25  a further period, not exceeding six months.\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD05105-01-1\n\n       A. 2365                             2\n\n    1    IF ANY SUCH SCHEDULE IS BASED ON PROJECTIONS OF REVENUES, EXPENDITURES\n    2  AND  UTILITY  OPERATIONS  FOR A PERIOD OF MORE THAN EIGHTEEN MONTHS, THE\n    3  COMMISSION SHALL ORDER THAT SUCH SCHEDULE INCLUDE ANNUAL PROJECTIONS  OR\n    4  REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES AND BENCHMARKS FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS,\n    5  SERVICE   QUALITY  AND SUCH OTHER PROJECTIONS AS THE COMMISSION MAY DEEM\n    6  APPROPRIATE, AND SHALL COMMENCE A PROCEEDING  TO  REVIEW  THE  CONTINUED\n    7  VALIDITY  OF SUCH PROJECTIONS NOT MORE THAN THREE MONTHS AFTER THE ANNI-\n    8  VERSARY  DATE OF THE DATE SUCH SCHEDULE BECAME EFFECTIVE. ALL PARTIES TO\n    9  THE  PROCEEDING AT WHICH THE SCHEDULE WAS ORIGINALLY CONSIDERED SHALL BE\n   10  ENTITLED TO  PARTY STATUS IN THE REVIEW PROCEEDING;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,\n   11  THAT  NOTHING  IN  THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL PRECLUDE THE ADMISSION  OF ADDI-\n   12  TIONAL PERSONS TO THE PROCEEDING IF  THEIR  INTERVENTION  IS  LIKELY  TO\n   13  CONTRIBUTE  TO   THE  DEVELOPMENT  OF A COMPLETE RECORD OR IS  OTHERWISE\n   14  FAIR AND IN THE  PUBLIC INTEREST.
