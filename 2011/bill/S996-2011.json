Legislative intent. The legislature  finds  and  declares\n    2  that  the  intellectual  property  generated  by  state-funded  research\n    3  represents a great opportunity to return social and  economic  value  to\n    4  the New York taxpayer in return for public investment in research. It is\n    5  further found and declared that the public interest in research outcomes\n    6  needs to be protected both by the state and by the beneficiaries of such\n    7  awards,  including  research  bodies who are the grant recipients. It is\n    8  further found and  declared  that  the  dissemination,  application  and\n    9  utilization  of  the  results  of research grants can play a significant\n   10  role in the development of new consumer and industrial products, of  new\n   11  industrial  processes,  and  in  the enhancement of the productivity and\n   12  competitiveness of business  involved  in  the  production  of  existing\n   13  products.  The  legislature further finds that the state needs to manage\n   14  its intellectual property effectively so that it is  best  utilized  for\n   15  the  benefit  of the state, the taxpayers, and the private sector. It is\n   16  further found and declared that state agency and public authority  poli-\n   17  cies should be appropriately formed and upheld in practice to ensure all\n   18  participants  in research and in commercialization of research discover-\n   19  ies understand their obligations and responsibilities.   Therefore,  the\n   20  legislature hereby declares the creation of the New York state intellec-\n   21  tual property asset management advisory council.\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD04990-01-1\n\n       S. 996                              2\n\n    1    S  2.
