KRUGER -- read twice and ordered printed, and when\n         printed to be committed to the Committee on Education\n\n       AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to  enacting  the  school\n         technology planning act\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as\n    2  the \"School Technology Planning Act\".\n    3    S 2. Legislative findings. a. The legislature finds that:\n    4    i.  Beginning with the 1997--1998 school year, schools became eligible\n    5  for federally mandated telecommunications discounts. Schools must  apply\n    6  for these dollars and will receive discounts on a first-come first-serve\n    7  basis.  Typically,  districts  best  poised  to access discounts and the\n    8  scores of public and private grants available for educational technology\n    9  are those which are more technologically advanced.  Districts which  are\n   10  typically less successful in accessing aid are those that need technical\n   11  assistance and do little or no planning.\n   12    ii.  A  good  percentage  of districts in New York state do not have a\n   13  technology plan or have a plan lacking essential components. Planning is\n   14  crucial to effective use  of  technology  integration  into  curriculum.\n   15  District  technology  planning  activities  go  a  long  way  in helping\n   16  districts plan,  implement  their  plans,  seek  funds,  coordinate  and\n   17  conduct  teacher  training,  provide  in-house technical assistance, and\n   18  maintain technology systems.\n   19    b. The legislature declares its intent to ameliorate the  deficiencies\n   20  it has identified in subdivision a of this section through the enactment\n   21  of  this  act  in  furtherance  of  equipping our students with the most\n   22  up-to-date educational tools needed for them to be self-sufficient func-\n   23  tioning members of society by participating in the  technology  that  is\n   24  revolutionizing that society.\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD06799-01-1\n\n       S. 2302                             2\n\n    1    S  3. The education law is amended by adding a new section 755 to read\n    2  as follows:\n    3    S  755. SCHOOL TECHNOLOGY PLANNING. 1. REGIONAL OR DISTRICT-WIDE TECH-\n    4  NOLOGY PLANNING. A.
