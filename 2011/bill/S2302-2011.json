Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as\n    2  the \"School Technology Planning Act\".\n    3    S 2. Legislative findings. a. The legislature finds that:\n    4    i.  Beginning with the 1997--1998 school year, schools became eligible\n    5  for federally mandated telecommunications discounts. Schools must  apply\n    6  for these dollars and will receive discounts on a first-come first-serve\n    7  basis.  Typically,  districts  best  poised  to access discounts and the\n    8  scores of public and private grants available for educational technology\n    9  are those which are more technologically advanced.  Districts which  are\n   10  typically less successful in accessing aid are those that need technical\n   11  assistance and do little or no planning.\n   12    ii.  A  good  percentage  of districts in New York state do not have a\n   13  technology plan or have a plan lacking essential components. Planning is\n   14  crucial to effective use  of  technology  integration  into  curriculum.\n   15  District  technology  planning  activities  go  a  long  way  in helping\n   16  districts plan,  implement  their  plans,  seek  funds,  coordinate  and\n   17  conduct  teacher  training,  provide  in-house technical assistance, and\n   18  maintain technology systems.\n   19    b. The legislature declares its intent to ameliorate the  deficiencies\n   20  it has identified in subdivision a of this section through the enactment\n   21  of  this  act  in  furtherance  of  equipping our students with the most\n   22  up-to-date educational tools needed for them to be self-sufficient func-\n   23  tioning members of society by participating in the  technology  that  is\n   24  revolutionizing that society.\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD06799-01-1\n\n       S. 2302                             2\n\n    1    S  3. The education law is amended by adding a new section 755 to read\n    2  as follows:\n    3    S  755. SCHOOL TECHNOLOGY PLANNING. 1. REGIONAL OR DISTRICT-WIDE TECH-\n    4  NOLOGY PLANNING. A.

  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2302\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the education law, in relation to enacting the school\ntechnology planning act\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nProvide schools with the necessary\ntools to plan for the use of educational technology in a manner that\nis driven by educational goals; directs the State Education\nDepartment to provide technical assistance to schools, review and\napprove school district plans and report to the legislature on\nplanning and funding.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nSection three of the bill amends the\neducation law by adding a new section 755. Section 755, subdivision 1\nrequires school districts, either individually or in combination with\none or more other districts to submit to the State. Education\nDepartment a five-year educational technology plan followed by annual\nupdates;\ndefines components to be included in the plan; and requires that\nteachers be included in the planning process. Section 755,\nsubdivision 2 defines the role of the department, requiring that the\ndepartment provide school districts with technical assistance, review\nand approve district technology plans, and report to the legislature\nand governor.\n\nEFFECTS OF PRESENT LAW WHICH THIS BILL WOULD ALTER:\nAdds a new section to the education law.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nDuring the 1997-98 school year, schools throughout New\nYork state became eligible for federally mandated telecommunications\ndiscounts pursuant to the 1996 federal Telecommunications Act.\nSchools must apply for these dollars and will receive discounts on a\nfirst-come, first-serve basis. Additionally, every year, scores of\npublic and private grants are available to schools with the\nwherewithal to apply for these dollars. The problem is the great\ndisparity between schools that have high-tech access and those that\ndo not. This situation is exacerbated because districts best poised\nto access discounts and grants are those which are typically more\ntechnologically advanced.\n\nDistricts which are usually less successful in accessing aid are those\nthat need technical assistance, do little or no planning and do not\nhave the staff to support the planning effort. This legislation\nprovides schools with the necessary tools to tap into the new\nfederally mandated discounts and other available grants; to better\ncompete with other districts which are already one step ahead; and to\n\naggressively pursue other dollars to meet ongoing technology needs.\nThe bill requires planning by schools; provides them with technical\nassistance; and requires a report to the Legislature from the State\nEducation Department.\n\nThe basis for this legislation is derived from an examination of the\neffectiveness of state funding streams and policies in meeting state\nand local goals for educational technology. Finding an absence of\ndata on planning, training, funding and services, the Assembly\ncommittee on oversight, Analysis and Investigation sent a survey to\nall school districts and received responses from about 60 percent of\nthe districts in New York State.\n\nSEE THE 1996 ASSEMBLY OVERSIGHT, ANALYSIS AND INVESTIGATION\nCOMMITTEE\nREPORT \"PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER\"\n\nThe results of the survey, in combination with SED data, underscore\nthe need to help districts that do not have the resources to help\nthemselves. The importance of long-term planning cannot be understated.\nTechnology is a big investment for districts and curriculum\nintegration is essential for effective use. This bill is aimed at\nensuring all school districts plan, that plans are based on\neducational goals and include certain components such as needs\nassessments, and that planning efforts include teachers. 26.7 percent\nof school districts responding to Oversight's survey have no plan. It\nis important to note that having a plan does not necessarily mean\nthat the plan is based on instructional goals, that the integration\nof technology is planned effectively or that it will be integrated\ninto curriculum. For instance, survey results indicate that only 57.1\npercent of districts have goals for technology integration in various\nsubjects or grade levels. This is an essential component of\nmeaningful educational technology planning. Through its office of\neducational technology, access to model educational technology plans\nand knowledge of federal actions, SED has expertise in the area of\neducational technology.\n\nThis legislation makes SED's expertise available to schools through\ntechnical assistance in helping schools develop and implement plans.\nIt also requires SED to review and approve school district plans to\nensure that minimal provisions are addressed and that plans are\nsound. This legislation also provides the Legislature with needed\ninformation to develop an effective approach to budgeting for\neducational technology in time for the 1999-2000 fiscal year. SED\nwill consider the information provided by schools in technology plans\nand will report to the Legislature and Governor with recommendations\non how to structure state technology aid to more effectively meet\nschools' needs.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
