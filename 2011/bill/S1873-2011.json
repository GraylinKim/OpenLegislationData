  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1873\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend chapter 106 of the laws of 2003, constituting the Patriot Plan,\nin relation to extending the applicability of a provision thereof for\nthe suspension of public retirement system loan repayment obligations\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nThis legislation would extend from\nJuly 1, 2010, the ability of members  of the military service to\nsuspend their repayment if loan to a retirement system while\nengaged in active service to the military.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThis bill would amend Section 43 of\nChapter 106 of the laws of 2003, constituting the Patriot Plan\nto extend the seven year sunset provision to nine years,\neffectively changing the date that this provision would\nexpire from July 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012.\n\nAs a result this bill would permit military service personnel\nengaged in active service to stop replaying any loan from a\nretirement system until they return from active duty for two\nadditional years.  The period of repayment is increased\ncorrespondingly with the amount of time missed due to\nmilitary service.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe law that allows military personnel to stop repaying loans from a\nretirement system while on active duty is set to expire on July 15 of\nthis year. This bill would prevent that expiration from occurring\nuntil July 1, 2012.\n\nThis law provides a benefit to military personnel allowing them to\nhalt payments for a loan to a retirement plan when engaged in active\nmilitary service. Such allows military personnel more financial\nfreedom when preparing to be deployed.\n\nThis bill would continue to provide such assistance to families of\nmilitary personnel as well as provide additional peace of mind to\nsoldiers, sailors, airmen while they are away. By providing the\nproper support to our troops we are allowing them to do their\ndifficult work without the distraction of problems as home.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nThis is a new bill.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\nAccording to the New York State and Local Employees' Retirement\nSystem, if this bill was enacted there will be a minimal cost. The\n\nNew York State Teachers' Retirement System estimates the cost to be\nnegligible.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately, except that if this act shall become a law after July 1,\n2010, it shall be deemed to have been in full effect since July 1,\n2010.\n\n",
