  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1656\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to creating the crime of identity\ntheft in the fourth degree\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nExpands the scope of the crime of identity theft to include attempts\nto assume the identity of another person.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThe penal law is amended to include a new section 190.77a to create\nthe crime of identity theft in the fourth degree. Makes the crime of\nidentity theft in the fourth degree a class A misdemeanor.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIdentity theft is an ongoing Crime in the State of New York. Some\nidentity theft is overt such as using stolen identification at a\nlocal or online retailer. Other forms of identity theft rely on\n\"phishing\" or \"social engineering\". Individuals masquerade as someone\nelse in order to gain information. They may, for example, contact a\nbank to learn if a potential victim has funds in their account. Or,\nthey may contact a large computing institution pretending to be an\nexecutive who \"forgot\" his/her password. Merely pretending to be\nsomeone else, without more, does not constitute a crime. This\nlegislation would address this gap in the existing identity theft law.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.7613 of 2008\n04/17/08 Referred to Codes\nS.115 of 2009\n01/07/09 REFERRED TO CODES\n01/06/10 REFERRED TO CODES\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the one hundred and twentieth day after it\nshall have become law.\n\n",
