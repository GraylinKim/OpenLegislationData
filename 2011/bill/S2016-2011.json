  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2016\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the education law, in relation to the establishment of\ncommunity college regions\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nTo amend the Education Law to authorize local community colleges,\ncollege sponsors, and eligible local governments to establish\ncommunity college regions to sponsor an existing community college\noperating under the program of State University of New York; to\ntransfer sponsorship from the existing sponsor to the community\ncollege region; and to protect upon transfer the employment and\ncollective bargaining rights of all employees of a community college.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nSection 1 amends subdivision two of section 6302 of the Education Law\nto remove a restriction which currently limits the availability of\ncommunity college regions as an optional form of community college\nsponsorship only to existing community colleges outside of New York\nCity sponsored by a school district or a city.\n\nSection 2 amends section 6310 of the Education Law by adding a number\nof specific provisions providing for the transfer of sponsorship of a\ncommunity college from its existing sponsor to a community college\nregion, including the transfer of community college assets, the\nassumption by the community college region of the liabilities and\nobligations of the community college, the retention of community\ncollege employees by the community college region, the recognition\nand retention of employment and collective bargaining benefits\nenjoyed by such employees after the transfer of sponsorship to a\ncommunity college region, and the authorization of all actions\nnecessary by the parties to the sponsorship transfer to avoid the\npossible invalidation of actions taken in good faith to accomplish\ntransfer due to the inadvertent failure to follow specific technical\nprocedures. These provisions had previously been contained in special\nlegislation passed with, and applicable only to, the establishment of\nthe Corning and Jamestown Community College Regions.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nIn 1985, the chancellor of State University established a task force\nto review and make appropriate recommendations in response to\nfindings on community colleges made in The Challenge and the Choice\nthe Report of the Independent Commission on the Future of the State\nUniversity. The task force was made up of four committees which\nstudied the areas of governance, articulation, academic and general\n\nprogrammatic issues, and funding. Several recommendations were\ndeveloped for each area. The governance recommendations addressed,\namong other matters, concerns related to the governance and fiscal\noperations of community colleges.\n\nNoting \"persistent problems\" experienced by some colleges in obtaining\nadequate financial support from local sponsors, both the Independent\nCommission on the Future of State University and the succeeding\nChancellor's Task Force on Community Colleges recommended governance\nby community college regions as an optional alternative form of\ncollege sponsorship.\n\nIn recommending the regional alternative, the Governance Committee of\nthe Chancellor's Task Force noted:\n\nThere are also community colleges which, for a variety of reasons,\nhave other problems which cannot be adequately addressed by change of\nthe fiscal mode of operation. For these colleges a more basic\nstructural change may be required, such as a regional sponsorship...\nRegionalism has been implemented successfully at Coming Community\nCollege...\n\nIn 1995, the State University chancellor appointed a task force to\nagain examine critical issues related to the administration and\ngovernance of SUNY's community colleges. The task force was composed\nof community college presidents,trustees, and faculty, as well as a\npresident of a SUNY State-operated college and a representative of\nthe New York State Association of Counties. Citing continued\nfinancial difficulties faced by community college sponsors throughout\nNew York State which continue to affect their ability to maintain\nnecessary levels of support for their community colleges, the task\nforce recommended broadening the availability of the authorization to\nestablish a community college region to any existing SUNY community\ncollege.\n\nThis measure will make available to all SUNY community colleges\noutside of New York City the statutory authority used to effectuate\nthe establishment of the Corning and Jamestown Community College\nRegions. Any proposed transfer of an existing community college to a\ncommunity college region would additionally require approval of the\ncollege trustees, all local governments involved, the State\nUniversity Board of Trustees, and, as appropriate, the passage of\nspecial legislation establishing the composition of the community\ncollege regional board of trustees and the terms of office of its\nmembers.\n\nOver the years community college educational programs, especially\nbusiness, technical, and career curricula, have assumed a growing\nimportance in local communities. some of the community college\nsponsors have experienced substantial financial strains maintaining\ncollege services and the quality of college academic offerings. This\ntrend is exacerbated by the limited tax base and population of\n\nindividual local governments in some regions of the State, and the\nincreasing cost of providing mandated services.\n\nCommunity colleges have become a critical part of the educational\nstructure of these economically hard-pressed areas. In many\ninstances, these colleges represent the only real opportunity for\nresidents of the college's sponsoring locality, and others living\nwithin the service area of the college, to obtain post-secondary\neducational opportunities.\n\nThis proposal would allow county governments in the vicinity of\ncommunity colleges currently sponsored by a county or counties to\ncombine to form a community college region.\nThe regional sponsor would have the necessary tax and population base\nto support high quality college academic and employment training\nprograms to serve the needs of all residents of the college's service\narea. This would have a positive impact, not only on educational\nquality, but on regional economic and job development.\n\nThis legislation would have no effect on the total cost of local\ngovernment sponsorship of a community college. There would be some\nshift in the apportionment of this cost among participants in the\ncommunity college region.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n2009-2010 S.2921; 2007-08, S.1243; 2005-2006, S.556-A; 2003-2004,\nS.303; 2002, S.2236; 1999, S.4601.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nThere would be no increased cost to the State, since the community\nfunding formula would not be affected.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
