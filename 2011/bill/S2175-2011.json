  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2175\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public health law, in relation to establishing training and\nregistration requirements for kidney dialysis patient care technicians\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill establishes training and registration requirements for\nkidney dialysis patient care technicians.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1: Adds a new Article 37-A to the public health law. The\nprovisions are as follows:\n\nSection 3720 - Adds definitions for kidney dialysis patient care\ntechnicians and kidney dialysis patient care technician trainees.\n\nSection 3721 - The Commissioner of Health, in consultation with the\nCommissioner of Education, shall establish training requirements for\nkidney dialysis patient care technicians. Such requirements shall\nhave clearly defined criteria for evaluating and training such\npersons. The law provides who may provide training of such\ntechnicians and the topics to be studied by such technician trainees.\n\nSection 3722 - No person may used the title of such technician or\nperform the work of a kidney dialysis patient care technician without\nsatisfying the provisions of this act.\n\nSection 3723 - This bill grants an exemption for certain technicians\nso that they will have sufficient time to satisfy the training\nrequirements of the act. Further, this will ensure that there is a\nreadily available supply of such technicians so that such services\ncan be provided in the near term, but with the understanding that in\nthe long term all technicians will be trained and qualified to\nperform such services.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nNone.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nCurrently, are no baseline educational or training requirements\nthat need to be satisfied to be employed as a kidney dialysis patient\ncare technician. An individual need only complete a health care\nfacility unit based orientation, which is usually of 6 to 8 weeks in\nduration.\n\nThis may be insufficient time to properly train and orient such a\ntechnician for all of the duties of their job. However, the current\nsystem expects such persons to be a fully functional team member in\nthis specialized field of medicine. Because there is no\n\nstandardization of training programs, orientation programs differ\nwithin a facility and between facilities. This non-standardization of\ntraining may negatively impact on patient care.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2008 - S.4607A - Referred to Health\n2010:  S.4063  - Referred to Health\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately, with provisions.\n\n",
