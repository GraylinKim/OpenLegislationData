  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2397\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public authorities law and the general municipal law,\nin relation to clarifying the\nregulatory authority of the New York power authority\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis act would clarify that the New York Power Authority retains\nregulatory jurisdiction over all municipal electric utilities with\ncertain exceptions.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 amends section 1014 of the public authorities law to clarify\nthat municipal electric utilities who purchase and distribute power\nfrom the New York Power Authority shall be regulated by the Authority\nand not by the Public Service Commission.\n\nSection 2 amends section 364 of the general municipal law to exempt\nfrom regulation by the Public Service commission those\nmunicipalities who distribute power from the New York Power\nAuthority but do not generate power for distribution.\n\nSection 3 sets forth the effective date of this Act.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nCurrently, Public Authorities Law section 1014 states that entities\nwhose power is generated exclusively by the New York Power Authority\nshall be regulated by the Authority and not the Public Service\nCommission. General Municipal Law section 364 provides that municipal\nelectric utilities shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Public\nService Commission.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nSmall municipalities across the state provide electric service to\ntheir residents through electric distribution systems run by the\nmunicipalities themselves. Pursuant to state and federal law, these\nmunicipalities receive an allocation of low-cost hydropower from the\nNiagara Power Project and through the New York Power Authority.\nBefore the deregulation of the power industry, these municipalities\npurchased all of their power through the power Authority. After\nderegulation, most municipalities now purchase a percentage of their\npower on the open market.\n\nAs the law is written, this brings them under the regulatory\njurisdiction of the Public Service Commission. Accordingly, whenever\na municipality needs to change its rates, it must: expend hundreds of\nthousands of dollars to hire experts and participate in a relatively\nadversarial race-making process before the PSC. The PSC was created\nto regulate the behavior of large, investor owned, for-profit utility\n\ncompanies, and to hold them accountable to the public. Small\nmunicipal utilities are already directly accountable to the public\nthrough local elections. It is for this reason that similarly\nsituated utilities, such as rural cooperative electric utilities and\nmunicipal water utilities, are not subjected to the PSC's regulatory\nauthority in this manner.\n\nThis legislation would restore the former state of affairs, where NYPA\nregulated all the municipal electric utilities. NYPA already works\nextensively with the municipal utilities because the vast majority of\ntheir power comes from NYPA. Moreover, NYPA already regulates several\nof the municipalities who still receive all of their power from NYPA.\nHowever, this would have no effect on the Public Service Commission's\napproval authority in regards to municipal utilities seeking to\nexercise franchise rights to serve areas outside of their corporate\nboundaries pursuant to section 68 of the Public Service law.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS7890-B of 2010 -Rules Committee\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nJanuary 1, 2012.\n\n",
