It is important to provide awareness,\nsupport and education to families and to the community at large\nabout congenital heart defects. Utilizing methods such as\nestablishing a special awareness day for this serious condition can\nhelp to increase awareness of this condition and assist families that\nhave suffered a loss due to CHD.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.7247 of 2008 Passed Senate, S.1036-A of 2009/2010\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediate.\n\n",
