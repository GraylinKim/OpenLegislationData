  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1528\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the public authorities law, in relation to providing free fare\non the metropolitan transportation authority transit systems\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nTo grant seniors citizens, sixty-five years of age or older, free\naccess to transit systems operated by the Metropolitan Transit\nAuthority.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nSection one amends subdivision 15-a of section 1266 of the Public\nAuthority Law to require that the New York City transit authority,\nthe Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Commuter Railroad\nCompany establish a no fare program for transportation on New York\ncity transit authority systems, the Long Island Rail Road and the\nMetro-North Commuter Railroad Company for senior citizens. Section\none also describes the requirements for no fare eligibility. Those\neligible for the no fare program must be senior citizens sixty-five\nyears of age or older. Section two is the effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nSenior citizens have been valued and respected members of our\ncommunities for a number of years. During those years they have\ncontributed immensely to this great state's workforce and economy\nwith their labor and taxes, respectively. Senior citizens, more often\nthan not, live on a fixed income. Furthermore, particularly in these\ntimes of economic hardships, more and more of their fixed income is\nspent on the increasing costs of food, housing, and medical\ntreatment. In most cases, mass transit is their main source of\ntransportation when going to hospitals for their routine medical\ntreatment or grocery stores to purchase food. Subsequently, a no fare\nprogram with respect to mass transit would be a well earned, well\ndeserved, and essential privilege for senior citizens.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-10:  Referred to Transportation (S.1089)\n2008:     Referred to Rules (S.8574)\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo de determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
