Legislative intent and declaration. The legislature hereby\n    2  finds and declares that a medicaid rate setting methodology for personal\n    3  care services, entitled \"Personal Care Trend Language\", was incorporated\n    4  in chapter 53 of the laws of 1990. The legislature further declares that\n    5  its intention in adopting the subject provisions of chapter  53  of  the\n    6  laws  of  1990  was  to  correct inadequacies and inconsistencies in the\n    7  amount of medicaid reimbursement paid to personal care providers  across\n    8  the  state  by  mandating  a  more  consistent  and  equitable  medicaid\n    9  reimbursement rate, ensuring thereby that personal care providers  would\n   10  be able and available to provide services to medically indigent elderly,\n   11  disabled, ill and infirm individuals.\n   12    The  legislature  further  finds  that, since their adoption, medicaid\n   13  personal care rate setting provisions of chapter 53 of the laws of  1990\n   14  have  from time to time been construed by public officials and agencies,\n   15  and in courts, in a manner inconsistent with the legislature's intent in\n   16  respect of those provisions, the public policy of the state, the  finan-\n   17  cial  viability of the personal care program and access by the public to\n   18  personal care services upon which thousands  of  the  state's  citizenry\n   19  rely.  Therefore,  the  legislature hereby finds and declares that it is\n   20  necessary to amend the subject provisions of chapter 53 of the  laws  of\n   21  1990 to clarify the legislature's intent in adopting the same.\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD01161-01-1\n\n       A. 190                              2\n\n    1    S 2.
