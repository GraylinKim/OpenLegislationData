  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S979                REVISED 01/10/2011\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the economic development law, the New York state\nurban development corporation act and the executive law, in\nrelation to small business crime prevention services\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nThis bill would improve New York's\nbusiness climate by providing for a program of small business crime\nprevention services and assistance.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nBill &sect; 1 adds a new &sect; 139 to the\nEconomic Development Law establishing a small business crime\nprevention services program within the Division for Small Business.\nThe small business crime prevention services program, directly and in\nconjunction with other state, Federal and local agencies, shall\nprovide small businesses with access to the following services:\n\n* information on strategies, best practices and programs offering\ntraining and assistance in prevention of crimes in and around the\npremises of small businesses or otherwise affecting small businesses,\nincluding but not limited to: assault, arson and other violent felony\noffenses;\nrobbery, burglary, theft, identity theft and fraud; and vandalism,\ngraffiti and other property damage;\n\n* information on eligibility and applications for financial assistance\nfor small business crime prevention services provided by the Urban\nDevelopment Corporation (see bill &sect;2 below);\n\n* information on eligibility and applications for other programs of\nfinancial assistance for small business crime prevention offered by\nstate or Federal agencies or local governments;\n\n* information on protecting the assets of small businesses from crime,\nincluding risk reduction strategies and insurance availability; and\n\n* information on responses to crime, including reporting of crimes,\nsubmitting insurance claims and crime victim assistance programs.\n\nThe small business crime prevention services program would also\nidentify issues relating to crime affecting small businesses and\nassist the Division in making recommendations for legislative,\nregulatory and programmatic actions to address such issues.\n\nBill &sect;2 adds a new paragraph (1) to subdivision 1 Unconsolidated Laws\n\n&sect;6266-m to add a new program under the Empire State Economic\nDevelopment Fund (administered by the Urban Development Corporation).\nThe small\nbusiness crime prevention assistance program would provide loans, loan\nguarantees, interest subsidies and grants to small businesses,\nmunicipalities, not-for-profit corporations or other organizations\nfor the purpose of preventing crimes against small businesses or on\nthe premises or in the vicinity of small businesses. Eligible\nactivities would include such items as initiating or maintaining\nbusiness watch programs, installation of lighting, security equipment\nand other physical improvements to prevent or deter criminal\nactivities, and the development and dissemination of information to\nowners, operators and employees of small businesses on effective\ncrime prevention strategies. preference in awarding assistance is\ngiven to projects that benefit distressed areas or other areas with a\ndemonstrated need based on crime statistics, provide a local or\nprivate-sector match, or demonstrate a likelihood of positive impact\non crime prevention.\n\nBill &sect;3 amends Executive Law &sect;837 to direct the Division of Criminal\nJustice Services to provide advice and assistance in the development\nof these programs.\n\nEFFECTS OF PRESENT LAW WHICH THIS BILL WOULD ALTER:\nThis bill would\nestablish new measures to assist in small business crime prevention.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIt is often said that \"an ounce of prevention is worth\na pound of cure\" - and that is clearly the case when dealing with\ncriminal behavior. The costs of crime are substantial, and are not\nonly paid by the victims. Crimes against small businesses in New\nYork's communities deprive the State of millions of dollars in sales\nand income tax revenues, and can cause small businesses to shut down,\nleading to a spiral of neighborhood decay.\n\nUnlike larger businesses, small businesses often lack the resources to\norganize and implement an effective crime prevention strategy on\ntheir own. There are effective measures, including Business Watch and\nFleet Watch programs (usually run jointly by Chambers of Commerce and\npolice agencies), lighting and other security enhancements, and\ntraining programs that can be effective in reducing crime in New\nYork's main streets and other small commercial areas. However, often\nsuch initiatives require effective promotion and, in some cases, seed\nmoney. This bill, which is modeled in part on successful similar\nprograms in Australia, would provide the organizational and financial\nresources needed to deliver cost-effective crime prevention programs\nto New York's small businesses, to the benefit of the wider community.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-10: S.5041/A.350 (Latimer) - reported and committed to finance\n2007-08: A.11843 - referred to small business\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\nAny additional\nresources needed for the Division for Small Business are expected to\nbe offset by the economic benefits of crime prevention, including the\nprevention of direct economic losses to the State through lower sales\ntax and income tax collections and the higher costs criminal\nactivities create for law enforcement and courts. The funding of\nsmall business\ncrime prevention assistance would be through the Empire State economic\ndevelopment fund (EDF) , a multipurpose fund providing grants, loans\nand other aid to meet various communities' needs. The funding level\nprovided for EDF purposes varies from year to year and is determined\nas part of the budget process. Local governments would stand to\nbenefit directly, as recipients of small business crime prevention\nassistance, as well as through the increased tax revenues resulting\nfrom more effective crime prevention.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nFirst day of April after having become a law.\n\n",
