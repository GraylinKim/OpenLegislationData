  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1527\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public authorities law, in relation to the membership of\nthe New York city\nwater board; and to repeal certain provisions of such law relating\nthereto\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo make changes to the composition of the New York city water\nboard.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection one of the bill would change the\ncomposition of the New York City water board from seven appointees,\nall by the mayor to four appointees by the mayor, one each by the\ncity comptroller, public advocate and speaker of the New York city\ncouncil.\n\nSection two makes certain technical amendments.\n\nSection three sets forth the effective date and the process and timing\nfor the new appointments.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe Water Board leases the City's\nwater and sewer\nsystem from the City and is required to set rates and collect\nrevenues sufficient to cover operating and debt service expenses.\nBoard powers and responsibilities are set forth in the statute\ncreating the Board and the NYC Municipal Water Finance Authority\n(\"NYW\"); the Lease between the Board and the City; and the Financing\nAgreement among the Board, the City and NYW.\n\nUnder the current statute, the Board consists of seven members\nappointed to two year terms by the Mayor. The Mayor also appoints the\nChairperson from among the members. If not reappointed, a member\nserves until replaced. Events of the past three years have\ndemonstrated that this sole Mayoral control of the Water Board does\nnot serve the best interests of the public.\n\nIn the FY 2008 - FY 2010 rate-setting cycles, three successive\ndouble-digit increases in water and sewer rates were imposed.\nFundamental questions about the factors contributing to such\nincreases were raised by Water Board members, civic and affordable\nhousing organizations, and elected officials.\n\nThese concerns came to a head in the FY 2009 rate-setting process in\nMay 2008. In response, then-DEP Commissioner Emily Lloyd committed to\nconduct an independent in-depth study of the overall rate structure,\nand to have the study completed in time to\ninform the Board's FY 2010 rate setting. The Water Board agreed to pay\nfor this study out of water and sewer fee revenues.\n\n\nAlso in 2008, another issue emerged that drew public and Water Board\nattention, that of gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale formation that\nunderlies, in part, the Catskill-Delaware watershed. This drilling\nincorporates a new technique called hydraulic fracturing that\ninvolves toxic chemicals and very high volumes of water. DEP's\nresponse to this new threat to the watershed was to commission a\nstudy with an indeterminate due date.\nSeveral members of the Board expressed concern that DEP was not moving\naggressively enough to protect the watershed from the risks of this\ndrilling, which could undercut the Filtration Avoidance Determination\nand the hundreds of millions of dollars the City has spent to protect\nthe watershed.\n\nSubsequent to these two instances of Board members challenging City\nactions, three of the Board members who had expressed concerns about\nCity policy resigned from the Board, one of them after having been\nreplaced as Chairman after many years of service. Under the new Board\nleadership, no effort has been made to hold the DEP to its commitment\nto complete the rate study, which as a result was not been completed\non the promised timetable and was not available in the Water Board's\n2010 rate-setting process. The DEP study on gas drilling is also\nincomplete after almost a year.\n\nThese actions and outcomes demonstrate the inadequacy of the Water\nBoard's current membership structure to safeguard the interests of\nratepayers and the water system. With full Mayoral control and\ncomposition, the Board is merely an instrument of City policy rather\nthan an independent actor. This affects not only the decisions of the\nBoard but the very process by which decisions are reached - there is\nno independent questioning, monitoring or accountability imposed on\nthe City.\n\nThis bill would address the Board's lack of true independence by\nadding appointees of other City-wide elected officials to the Board.\nIt would not expand the Board, but rather, replace 3 of the 7 Mayoral\nappointees with appointees of the City Comptroller, City Council\nSpeaker, and Public Advocate. While the Mayor would continue to\nappoint a majority, these new members would ensure that new and\nongoing challenges would be addressed freely and impartially.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009:  Referred to Rules\n2010:  Referred to Corporations, Authorities & Commissions\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately, with provisions.\n\n",
