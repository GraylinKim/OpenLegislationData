  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1681\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the legislative law, in relation to clarifying the\nappropriation and qualification of member items and authorizes the\nlegislative ethics commission to review violations of the qualification\nof member items; and to amend the state finance law, in relation to\nrequiring that all member items be fully itemized\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nTo prevent conflicts of interest in the distribution of member item\nfunds, increase transparency of the member item process, and ensure\nthat member item funds are used efficiently.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\n* Defines the term \"member item\"\n\n* Provides that no member item shall be distributed when a conflict of\ninterest exists between the legislator or the governor designating\nthe member item and the potential recipient.\n\n* Defines the term \"conflict of interest.\"\n\n* Requires each legislator or governor to sign a conflict of interest\nform under perjury of law.\n\n* Provides that each member of the assembly and senate shall receive\nthe same allocation as the other members in their respective house.\n\n* Provides that any state agency providing funding for member items\nevaluate the spending by the recipient to ensure that the money is\nbeing used for its intended purpose.\n\n* Establishes detailed criteria to be followed when distributing\nmember items.\n\n* Requires recipients of a member item totaling $50,000 or more to\nfile a final report with the New York State Attorney General\n\n* Prior to submitting an application for a member item, potential\nrecipients must meet pre-clearance standards as established by the\nAttorney General.\n\n* All member items shall be listed separate and apart from the entire\nstate budget.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nCurrently, the member item process is neither equitable, open or\nefficient. This bill would add fairness, transparency, and\naccountability to a broken system. Clearly, the process is unfair;\n\nsome legislators receive large amounts of funding for their\ndistricts, while others\nreceive little or no funding. There is no rational basis for this\nsystem. Furthermore, the current system does not take adequate\nmeasures to ensure that member item funds are used appropriately.\nThis bill would go to great lengths to establish standards to ensure\nthat member item funds are used effectively for projects that have a\npublic purpose.\nFinally, the bill would seek to make the member item process more open\nby requiring Publication of important member item information at\nleast 24 hours prior to the approval of the state budget.\n\nWe should hold ourselves, and our colleagues, accountable to the\nresidents of New York. Member items are paid for with taxpayer money.\nThe current member item system is full of waste and scandal. This\nlegislation would help fix the broken system. It is particularly\nimportant now, with the state facing a fiscal crisis, that we insist\non integrity of the member item process.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nNew legislation.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
