Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as\n    2  the \"New  York state comprehensive information system (NYSCIS) act\".\n    3    S 2. Legislative findings. State agencies and  the  libraries  of  New\n    4  York  individually  license  and purchase electronic databases and other\n    5  information resources. Access to information is not only  vital  to  the\n    6  functioning of our democracy, but also to creating an environment condu-\n    7  cive  to  learning,  research  and  innovation.  The coordination of the\n    8  selection and purchase of these  resources  by  the  state  library  and\n    9  office  for  technology  would  result  in greater efficiencies and cost\n   10  savings for the public and foster improved access to information  across\n   11  the  state.  Therefore, it is in the best interests of the state and its\n   12  libraries to enact the \"New York state comprehensive information  system\n   13  (NYSCIS) act\".\n   14    S  3. The education law is amended by adding a new section 286 to read\n   15  as follows:\n   16    S 286. NEW YORK STATE COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION SYSTEM.   1.
