The exemption of a homestead is\n    3  not  void  because  the  value of the property exceeds one hundred fifty\n    4  thousand  dollars  for  the  counties of Kings, Queens, New York, Bronx,\n    5  Richmond, Nassau, Suffolk, Rockland, Westchester and Putnam; one hundred\n    6  twenty-five thousand dollars  for  the  counties  of  Dutchess,  Albany,\n    7  Columbia, Orange, Saratoga and Ulster; and seventy-five thousand dollars\n    8  for  the  remaining  counties  of  the  state but the lien of a judgment\n    9  attaches to the surplus.\n   10    (e) Sale of homestead  exceeding  [one]  TWO  hundred  fifty  thousand\n   11  dollars  for  the  counties of Kings, Queens, New York, Bronx, Richmond,\n   12  Nassau, Suffolk, Rockland, Westchester and Putnam; one  hundred  twenty-\n   13  five  thousand  dollars  for the counties of Dutchess, Albany, Columbia,\n   14  Orange, Saratoga and Ulster; and seventy-five thousand dollars  for  the\n   15  remaining  counties  of  the  state  in  value.  A judgment creditor may\n   16  commence a special proceeding in the county in which  the  homestead  is\n   17  located  against  the  judgment  debtor  for  the  sale, by a sheriff or\n   18  receiver, of a homestead exceeding  [one]  TWO  hundred  fifty  thousand\n   19  dollars  for  the  counties of Kings, Queens, New York, Bronx, Richmond,\n   20  Nassau, Suffolk, Rockland, Westchester and Putnam; one  hundred  twenty-\n   21  five  thousand  dollars  for the counties of Dutchess, Albany, Columbia,\n   22  Orange, Saratoga and Ulster; and seventy-five thousand dollars  for  the\n   23  remaining  counties of the state in value. The court may direct that the\n   24  notice of petition be served upon any other person.  The  court,  if  it\n   25  directs  such a sale, shall so marshal the proceeds of the sale that the\n   26  right and interest of each person in the proceeds  shall  correspond  as\n   27  nearly  as may be to his right and interest in the property sold. Money,\n   28  not exceeding [one] TWO hundred fifty thousand dollars for the  counties\n   29  of  Kings, Queens, New York, Bronx, Richmond, Nassau, Suffolk, Rockland,\n   30  Westchester and Putnam; one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars for the\n   31  counties of Dutchess, Albany, Columbia, Orange, Saratoga and Ulster; and\n   32  seventy-five thousand dollars for the remaining counties of  the  state,\n   33  paid to a judgment debtor, as representing his interest in the proceeds,\n   34  is  exempt for one year after the payment, unless, before the expiration\n   35  of the year, he  acquires  an  exempt  homestead,  in  which  case,  the\n   36  exemption  ceases  with  respect  to  so  much  of  the money as was not\n   37  expended for the purchase of that property; and  the  exemption  of  the\n   38  property  so  acquired  extends to every debt against which the property\n   39  sold was exempt. Where the exemption of property sold as  prescribed  in\n   40  this  subdivision  has been continued after the judgment debtor's death,\n   41  or where he dies after the sale and before payment to him of his portion\n   42  of the proceeds of the sale, the court may direct that  portion  of  the\n   43  proceeds  which  represents  his interest be invested for the benefit of\n   44  the person or persons entitled to the benefit of the  exemption,  or  be\n   45  otherwise disposed of as justice requires.\n   46    S  2.  This  act  shall take effect immediately and shall be deemed to\n   47  have been in full force and effect on and after August 30, 2005.\n",
