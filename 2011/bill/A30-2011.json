Use of state and county eligible lists by municipal commissions.  A\n   34  municipal commission, in the absence of an eligible list of its own, may\n   35  request the state civil service department, county civil service commis-\n   36  sion or county personnel officer to furnish it with the names of persons\n   37  on  an  appropriate eligible list established by the department, commis-\n   38  sion or personnel officer, which,  if  so  requested  by  the  municipal\n   39  commission,  shall be limited to residents of the city, or town or civil\n   40  division in which appointments are to be made, or to  residents  of  the\n   41  county  or  judicial district in which such city, town or civil division\n   42  is located, or to any reasonable combination of  political  subdivisions\n   43  both  in  and  outside of New York state contiguous to the city or civil\n   44  division in which appointment is to be made or contiguous to  the  poli-\n   45  tical  subdivision  in  which  such  city  or civil division is located,\n   46  EXCEPT FOR THE POSITION OF DIRECTOR OF FACILITIES I,  II,  &  III  OF  A\n   47  SCHOOL DISTRICT LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE WHICH SHALL USE THE LIST DEVEL-\n   48  OPED  PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION FIVE OF SECTION SEVENTEEN OF THIS CHAPTER.\n   49  Such municipal commission may certify such names for  appointment  to  a\n   50  position under its jurisdiction in the same manner as certifications are\n   51  made  from  the  eligible  lists  of such commission. If the state civil\n   52  service department, county civil service commission or county  personnel\n   53  officer, upon the request of such commission, has certified an appropri-\n   54  ate eligible list to fill a particular position, such list shall contin-\n   55  ue  to  be used until superseded by an eligible list established by such\n\n       A. 30                               5\n\n    1  municipal commission for such position, or until such list expires or is\n    2  exhausted or is otherwise terminated.\n    3    4-a.  Residence  restrictions  for  local  positions.  The state civil\n    4  service department or  municipal  commission  having  jurisdiction  over\n    5  positions  in  a  city or civil division may require that candidates for\n    6  examination for appointment to any such positions be residents  of  such\n    7  city  or civil division, or residents of the county or judicial district\n    8  in which such city or civil division is located, or  of  any  reasonable\n    9  combination  of  political  subdivisions both in and outside of New York\n   10  state contiguous to such city or civil division  or  contiguous  to  the\n   11  political  subdivision  in which such city or civil division is located,\n   12  EXCEPT FOR CANDIDATES FOR THE POSITION OF DIRECTOR OF FACILITIES I,  II,\n   13  &  III  OF  A  SCHOOL  DISTRICT  LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE. An appointing\n   14  authority of a department or agency of a  city  or  civil  division  may\n   15  require  that eligibles who are residents of such city or civil division\n   16  shall be certified first for appointment, EXCEPT FOR CANDIDATES FOR  THE\n   17  POSITION  OF  DIRECTOR  OF  FACILITIES I, II, & III OF A SCHOOL DISTRICT\n   18  LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE, WHEREIN NO SUCH RESIDENCE  REQUIREMENTS  SHALL\n   19  APPLY,  provided, however, no such preference shall be given on appoint-\n   20  ments from promotion lists. Upon exhaustion of the list of such resident\n   21  eligibles, certifications shall be made from the  whole  eligible  list.\n   22  This subdivision shall not be deemed to supersede any general or special\n   23  law  pertaining to residence qualifications of local officers or employ-\n   24  ees; provided,  however,  that  any  permanent  employee  who  has  been\n   25  suspended  or  demoted  from  a  position and is on a preferred list for\n   26  reinstatement, shall not be barred  from  reinstatement  solely  on  the\n   27  basis  of  residency requirements established subsequent to such suspen-\n   28  sion or demotion, in the event the employee does not meet such residence\n   29  qualifications but, nonetheless, was originally properly appointed.\n   30    S 4. This act shall take effect immediately.\n",
