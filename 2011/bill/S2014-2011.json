  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2014\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nin relation to allowing Marion Hoffman to file a request for Tier I\nstatus in the New York state and local police and fire retirement system\nwith the state comptroller\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nTo authorize Marion Hoffman to file a request for Tier I status in the\nNew York State and Local Police and Fire Retirement System.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nMarion Hoffman has been employed with the New York State Department of\nEnvironmental Conservation as an Environmental Conservation Officer\nfor approximately thirty-six years. For reasons not ascribable to her\nown negligence, she did not become a member of the New York State and\nLocal Police and Fire Retirement System at the time of hiring.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nMarion Hoffman was hired on June 14, 1973, due to the temporary,\ncompetitive classification of her appointment membership in the\nretirement system was not mandatory, and thus her membership in the\nretirement system did not take effect until the time her application\nwas received by the retirement system which was August 1, 1973.\nBetween those dates, Tier II status took effect and thus Ms. Hoffman\nwas granted Tier II status and not Tier I status.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.7574 of 2010:  Referred to Civil Service & Pensions\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nIncrease of approximately $920 in the annual contributions of the State\nof New York for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012.
