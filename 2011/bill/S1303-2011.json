  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1303\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the elder law, in relation to adding a requirement for the\nstate office for the aging to report on the delivery of services to and\nneeds of traditionally underserved populations in their annual report to\nthe governor and legislature\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nTo require the State Office of the Aging to assess the needs of and\ndelivery of services to traditionally under served populations and to\nprovide technical assistance to organizations that provide services\nto the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender senior populations.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThe bill requires that the State Office of the Aging, in its annual\nreport to the Governor and the Legislature, include recommendations\nfor expanding or replicating service programs to populations\nincluding, but not limited to, populations based on actual or\nperceived race, creed, color, national origin, sexual orientation,\ngender identity or expression, military status, sex, marital status,\ndisability, familial status, and language.\n\nThe bill requires that the State Office of the Aging, in its annual\nreport to the Governor and the Legislature, assess the progress,\nproblems, and effectiveness of provisions or services to seniors\nadministered by the Office to populations including, but not limited\nto, actual or perceived race, creed, color, national origin, sexual\norientation, gender identity or expression, military status, sex,\nmarital status, disability, familial status, and language, or people\nassociated with an individual who is or is perceived to be a member\nof any of these traditionally underserved populations.\n\nThe bill requires that the Office of the Aging, in its annual report\nto the Governor arid the Legislature, report on the needs of\ntraditionally underserved senior populations including, but not\nlimited to, populations based on actual or perceived race, creed,\ncolor, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or\nexpression, military status, sex, marital status, disability,\nfamilial status, and language.\n\nThe bill authorizes the director of the Office of the Aging to make\ngrants-in-aid available, through a request for proposals process, for\nthe purpose of)providing training, outreach, and education to\nappropriate entities who provide services to the lesbian, gay,\nbisexual, and transgender senior populations.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe experience of marginalization place many traditionally underserved\nsenior populations at a higher risk for isolation, poverty,\n\nhomelessness, and premature institutionalization. Moreover, many\nmembers of traditionally underserved populations are members of\nmultiple underrepresented groups, and as a result, are doubly\nmarginalized. Due to these factors, many seniors avoid accessing\nelder programs and services, even when their health, safety, and\nsecurity depend on it.\n\nBy the year 2025, it is projected that there will be 4.4 million New\nYorkers 60 years of age and older. thereby increasing the number of\nseniors who are receiving inadequate services. For the first time in\nour state's history, we will have two very large generations of\nsenior citizens in New York. It is important to ensure that as we\ncraft new policies and expand existing services to meet the needs of\nseniors statewide, that we ensure that underrepresented groups are\nadequately assessed during the planning and development of programs\nand services.\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) seniors, in particular,\noften lack social and familial support networks that are more\ncommonly available to non-LGBT seniors. LGBT seniors are twice as\nlikely to live alone as compared to heterosexual seniors, and more\nthan four times as likely to have no children.\n\nLGBT seniors face stigma from many senior care providers who do not\nconsider that their older clients may be LGBT. As a result, LGBT\nseniors may be as much as five times less likely to access needed\nhealth and social services because of fear of discrimination.\n\nSince disease prevention strategies tend to ignore LGBT seniors, and\nHIV trials generally do not include older participants, LGBT seniors\nmay also face greater health risks.\n\nAdditionally, same-sex couples have less access to financial benefits\nas compared to heterosexual married couples. A surviving same-sex\npartner, for example, will be denied social security benefits and be\nrequired to pay taxes on the transfer of assets upon the death of a\npartner.\n\nMaking grants-in-aid available from the New York State Office of the\nAging, will provide important assistance to individuals, agencies,\nand other appropriate -entities to improve their delivery of services\nto LGBT senior populations.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n2009: S1385 (Duane), Died in Aging; A3956 (Kellner), Passed Assembly\n2010: S1385 (Duane), Died in Aging; A3956 (Kellner), Passed Assembly\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nUnknown.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
