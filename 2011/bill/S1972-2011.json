  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1972\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act to amend the election law, in relation to allowing for polling\nplace voter registration for any qualified person who is not registered\nto vote\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nSection 5-210 of election law is amended by adding a new subdivision 1-a\nwhich enables qualified persons to register to vote.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThis legislation seeks to set parameters and guidelines fix Election Day\nvoter registration. Allowing for persons eligible to vote to register to\nvote up until and on Election Day has increased voter turnout in the six\nstates (Idaho, Maine, Minnesota.  New Hampshire.  Wisconsin and Wyom-\ning). On average, turnout was 14% higher in EDR states than across the\ncountry in the 2004 election cycle. New York consistently ranks near the\nbottom in voter turnout in the country.  It is imperative that state\ntake every action necessary to allow eligible voters the involved in\nelections until the very last moment when often it is too late to regis-\nter to vote. This must be changed, voters should have the ability to\nregister and vote Election Day.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nNone.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis shall take effect January 1, 2012.\n\n",
