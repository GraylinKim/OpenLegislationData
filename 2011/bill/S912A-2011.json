Also,  the  taxpayer may still benefit from the Basic STAR\nexemption or the Enhanced STAR exemption for senior citizens.  The cred-\nit will equal seventy  percent  of  the  taxes  paid  over  the  allowed\npercentage cap as provided in the bill.\n\nThe  act  would also provide for a \"real property tax equivalent\" in the\ncase of taxpayers who rent real property as their primary New York State\nresidence.\n\nFor taxable years starting in 2014 the \"real  property  tax  equivalent\"\nequal  to  15%  of  the adjusted rent actually paid in the taxable year.\ntaxable years starting in 2015, the amount is increased to  20%  of  the\nadjusted rent actually paid in the taxable year.\n\nSECTION  2: Creates a tax reform study commission with appointments from\nthe Senate, Assembly and the Executive. The commission will  review  the\nstate's  existing  property  tax  reform  programs  as  well as programs\nenacted in other states.\n\nSECTION 3: Contains the effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe  middle class property tax circuit breaker program is a concept that\nhas successfully been used in several states to Provide  relief  from  a\nresidential  homeowner's  property tax when it exceeds a certain portion\nof their household income. It has been traditionally Used for homeowners\nwith very low incomes and low assessments. New York State currently  has\na  circuit breaker provision that has existed for decades, but the maxi-\nmum eligible household income is $18,000 and the maximum  eligible  home\nvalue is $85,000. This new program would target middle-class New Yorkers\nwho  have  financially  suffered as municipalities have had to rely more\nheavily on real property taxes for local government revenue. Many  home-\nowners  are  facing sky-racking real property tax bills as a result they\nare often faced with the serious threat of defaulting on their  property\ntaxes and/or seriously consider selling their homes.\n\nCritics of the New York's STAR program have claimed that it is inequita-\nble because it does not draw a connection between a taxpayer's household\nincome  and  the  amount  of  his tax bill. The Middle Class STAR Rebate\nChecks program,  which  began  in  1970  and  was  eliminated  in  2009,\ncompounded this effect because it calculated a household's rebate amount\nas  a  percentage  of  the value of its STAR exemption. This legislation\nseeks to resolve these limitations and remain sensitive to  the  State's\ncurrent financial crisis.  Additionally, the bill would add progressivi-\nty  to  property  tax relief and extend the benefits to property renters\nwho are often burdened with property taxes in the cost  of  their  rent.\nThe  bill  is  phased  in  over  four years in order to take the state's\nfiscal situation into consideration while ensuring that the  most  over-\nburdened  property taxpayers, based on the percentage of income they are\npaying in property tax on their home, will get relief quickly.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nNone.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nThe program is phased in over four years and will cost the State nothing\nin the first year. For year two the cost  will  be  $1.1  billion;  year\nthree  will  cost  $1.8  billion  and  every  year  after will cost $2.3\nbillion.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately after enactment.\n\n",
