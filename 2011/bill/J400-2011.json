Identify  opportunities  for  eliminating or reducing unfunded and\nunderfunded mandates imposed by the New York State government  on  local\ngovernments and school districts; and\n  6.

Promote  inter-municipal  and  inter-school  district  cooperation,\ncoordination,  and  consolidation,  so  as to reduce costs and expenses,\nincluding, but not limited  to  contracting,  purchasing  and  personnel\ncosts; and\n  7. Reduce, control and eliminate regulations imposed by state law upon\nlocal  governments  and  school  districts,  which negatively impact the\noperations and services they provide; and\n  WHEREAS,  This  comprehensive  approach  of  capping  property  taxes,\ncontrolling  governmental  costs and spending, and providing significant\nmandate reform relief to local governments and school districts,  offers\nthe  most effective solution to the problem that real property taxes are\ntoo high, and provides the long term fiscal program necessary to  perma-\nnently  reduce the real property tax burden upon all the citizens, home-\nowners, businesses and taxpayers of New York State; and\n  WHEREAS, A real property tax cap, of the type offered in  Senate  Bill\n2706,  the  Governor's Program Bill Number 1, is only a foundational and\nfundamental first step, of what needs to be enacted in order  to  accom-\nplish this comprehensive approach; and\n  WHEREAS,  That  in  addition to what is contained in such proposed tax\ncap legislation, Senate Bill 2706, this  Legislature  and  the  Governor\nneed be committed to further enacting, in the immediate near future, the\nadditional taxpayer protections and mandate relief measures necessary to\nassure that the problem of oppressive real property taxes will be quick-\nly corrected in a comprehensive, lasting and effective manner; and\n  WHEREAS,  It  is  only  through  the  enactment  of this comprehensive\napproach of a real property tax cap law, together with effective mandate\nreform relief measures to control costs  and  spending  for  both  local\ngovernments  and  school  districts,  that New York can realize the long\nterm and meaningful real property tax reductions that our state and  its\ntaxpayers so desperately need; now, therefore, be it\n  RESOLVED,  That  this  Legislative  Body pause in its deliberations to\nhereby urge Governor Andrew M.

Cuomo, and his Mandate Relief and  Medicaid  Redesign\nTeams,  to  comprehensively  address a real property tax cap and mandate\nrelief reform, in order to promote the development of  effective  legis-\nlation,  that  contains  both a real property tax cap, and extensive and\neffective mandate relief measures to control costs and spending for both\nlocal governments and school districts; and be it further\n  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body  pause  further  to  hereby  urge\nGovernor  Andrew  M. Cuomo, and his Mandate Relief and Medicaid Redesign\nTeams, to comprehensively address a real property tax  cap  and  mandate\nrelief  reform  in  order to promote the development of effective legis-\nlation, that accordingly provides the taxpayers of New York  State  with\nthe  lasting and meaningful real property tax relief that our state, its\ntaxpayers, and our economy so desperately need; and be it further\n  RESOLVED, That copies of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be tran-\nsmitted to the Honorable Andrew M.
