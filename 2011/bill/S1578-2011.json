  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1578\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the education law, in relation to required training for\nindividuals applying for certification or licensure to be a teacher\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 amends education law by adding a new subdivision 2-a to\n&sect;3004 to require, as part of licensure and certification for teachers\na minimum of six hours of course work or training in how to recognize\nand respond to incidents of bullying, harassment and intimidation.\nEach applicant shall provide the State Education Department with\ndocumentation showing that they have successfully completed the\nrequired training.\n\n(2-b) requires coursework and training be provided by an institution\nor provider which has been approved by the State Education Department.\n\n(2-c) defines bullying, harassment and intimidation.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nBullying at school is a pervasive problem that affects millions of\nstudents every year. The National Center for Education Statistics\nindicates student bullying is one of the most frequently reported\ndiscipline problems at school: 21% of elementary schools, 43% of\nmiddle schools, and 22% of high schools reported problems with\nbullying in 2005-06.\n\nA study cited in an American Medical Association report on bullying\nfound over two-thirds of students believe that schools respond poorly\nto bullying, with a high percentage of students believing that adult\nhelp is infrequent and ineffective. These findings suggest that\nteachers are simply unaware of much of the bullying that occurs\naround them (likely because much of the bullying is difficult to\ndetect and because children frequently are reluctant to report\nbullying to adults).\n\nBy requiring pre-service training, new teachers will be better\nequipped to identify and respond to potentially damaging\nvictimization, as well as to implement positive feedback and modeling\nto address appropriate social interactions.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.7759 in 2009 - Advanced to third reading\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to state.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis bill will take effect on the one hundred twentieth day following\nthe date on which it shall have become law.\n\n",
