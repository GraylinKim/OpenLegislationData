  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2515\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the executive law, in relation to authorizing the division of\nveterans' affairs to provide for the interment of the unclaimed remains\nof veterans\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA:\nAuthorizes the division of veterans' affairs\nto provide for the interment of the unclaimed remains of veterans.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nSection 353 of the\nexecutive law is\namended by adding a new subdivision 12-a, that would provide, in\ncooperation of veterans service organizations, for the interment of\nthe unclaimed remains of veterans and direct the state director to\nconsult with veterans service organizations to analyze the scope of\nthe issue of unclaimed remains for veterans.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nToo often, when a veteran dies and is subsequently\ncremated, their remains, whether due to neglect by loved ones or lack\nthereof, go unclaimed and are left to sit on the shelf of mortuaries.\nThis practice is most inappropriate considering their heroic service\nto our country. This legislation would ensure that the unclaimed\nremains of our service men and women will be rightfully interred with\nthe dignity they deserve.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nNone.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the first of January\nnext succeeding the date on which it shall have become law.\n\n",
