MILLER,  MOLINARO,\n         OAKS, REILICH, SAYWARD, SPANO -- read once and referred to the Commit-\n         tee on Environmental Conservation\n\n       AN ACT creating the cellulosic ethanol task force; and providing for the\n         repeal of such provisions upon the expiration thereof\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and\n    2  declares it necessary to prevent and reduce the production and emanation\n    3  of greenhouse gases and in doing so, finds it necessary to create a task\n    4  force  to  be  known as the \"cellulosic ethanol task force\" to study and\n    5  advance the production of cellulosic  ethanol  in  furtherance  of  such\n    6  goal.\n    7    As our nation continues to focus on various forms of renewable energy,\n    8  one of the future sources is cellulosic ethanol. Cellulosic ethanol is a\n    9  type  of  ethanol  that  is  derived  from cellulose instead of standard\n   10  sugars and starches. The  benefit  of  cellulosic  ethanol  is  that  it\n   11  substantially  reduces  the emission of greenhouse gases even in compar-\n   12  ison to other types of ethanol. This ethanol type can be harvested  from\n   13  crops  grown  within  our  state. It is therefore essential that experts\n   14  provide our state, and our nation, with information  and  recommendation\n   15  of  what  type  of crops can produce such ethanol and where in our state\n   16  such crops are best grown.\n   17    S 2. The commissioner of the department of agriculture and markets  is\n   18  hereby  directed to develop a task force within such department to study\n   19  the feasibility of growing crops for cellulosic ethanol production. This\n   20  task force shall be comprised of no more than nine members. The  members\n   21  shall  be  selected  by the commissioner of agriculture and markets. The\n   22  task force shall, however, include at least one member selected  by  the\n   23  state  soil  and water conservation board and one member selected by the\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD04552-01-1\n\n       A. 3155                             2\n\n    1  commissioner of the department of  environmental  conservation.    There\n    2  shall be no compensation for the members of the task force. The cost for\n    3  attending meetings and additional needs shall be covered by the state.\n    4    A  report of the findings of such study, recommendations of the super-\n    5  intendent of insurance and any proposed legislation necessary to  imple-\n    6  ment such findings shall be filed with the governor, the temporary pres-\n    7  ident of the senate, the speaker of the assembly, the minority leader of\n    8  the  senate,  and  the  minority  leader of the assembly within one year\n    9  after the effective date of this act.\n   10    S 3. This act shall take effect immediately and shall  expire  and  be\n   11  deemed repealed one year after such date.\n",
