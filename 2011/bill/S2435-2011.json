This legislation seeks\nto incorporate a uniform system for siting windmills. In order to\nestablish a system where piecemeal siting of windmills may benefit\none county, yet cause stress to a neighboring one, it is necessary to\nhave regional boards to weigh the pros and cons of wind siting\napplications.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010 - S.7923 Referred to Environmental Conservation\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nMinimal resources to establish and maintain each\nregional board.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
