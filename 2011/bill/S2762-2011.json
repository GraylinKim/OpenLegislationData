  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2762\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to the definition of serious offense\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill would improve public safety and prevent domestic\nviolence incidents from escalating into even greater violence by\nkeeping guns out of the hands of domestic violence perpetrators.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 amends subdivision 17 of section\n265.00 of the Penal Law by adding a new paragraph c to include any\noffense which would constitute a family offense pursuant to section\neight hundred twelve of the family court act, where the victim of\nsuch offense was a family or household member as defined in that\nsection. The legislation treats conduct which constitutes a violation\nunder the penal law differently than conduct which would constitute a\nmisdemeanor or felony insofar as where an allegation of a violation\nis sustained by the family court, the respondent may motion the court\nto vacate the \"serious offense\" designation three years after\ndisposition of the case. The legislation provides factors which the\nfamily court shall apply when hearing such a motion. Upon deciding\nthe motion the court must set its reasons on the record.\n\nSection 2 establishes the effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nA firearm in the hands of any criminal is a threat,\nespecially in the hands of a noted domestic batterer. Fifty-four\npercent of female homicides are committed with a firearm and two\nthirds of all women killed with firearms are killed by their male\npartners. By prohibiting perpetrators of domestic violence from\nlawfully possessing a firearm, this legislation will protect both\npartners, and decrease the propensity for a batterer to continue on a\npath of violence which may escalate to fatal consequences through the\nuse of a gun.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-10: S.4685A - Referred to Codes Committee\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
