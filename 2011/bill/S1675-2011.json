By\nremoving these provisions, all individuals convicted of a felony or\nmisdemeanor must be classified as a designated offender and submit DNA.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nBy expanding DNA submissions to all individuals convicted of felonies\nand misdemeanors, the bill will dramatically increase the number of\ncriminals registered with the identification index. By making such\nimprovements to the index, the bill will give law enforcement\nofficers a resource that will allow them to more effectively fight\ncrime by identifying suspects that could have otherwise gone\nunidentified.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.2094 of 2007\n01/31/08 Referred to Finance\nS.116 of 2009\n01/07/09 REFERRED TO FINANCE\n01/06/10 REFERRED TO FINANCE\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the first of November next succeeding\nthe date on which it shall have become a law.\n\n",
