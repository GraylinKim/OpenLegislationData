  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1745\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the vehicle and traffic law and the education law, in relation\nto electronic monitoring\nequipment on school buses in the city of New York\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nSection 1 amends section 375 of the vehicle and traffic law by\ninserting a new subdivision 21(j) to require that every new school bus\npurchased for transportation of seven or more passengers in New York\nCity on or after September first, two thousand eleven, be equipped\nwith a school bus electronic monitoring system, by which is meant one\nor more electronic devices capable of recording the speed, sound,\nconduct and movement of persons within the driver and passenger\ncompartments of the bus.\nSuch system may also include one or more devices designed to simulate\nthe appearance of an operable video camera or other device. Every\nexisting bus would have to meet the requirements by 2017.\n\nSection 2 amends the education law by adding new section 3624, to\nrequire the Education Commissioner in consultation with the\ncommissioner of DOT and DMV to promulgate regulations concerning the\nequipping, placement, installation, and use of school bus electronic\nmonitoring systems in school buses in New York City, consistent with\nthe following:\n\n1. All New York City school buses shall be equipped with school bus\nelectronic monitoring systems, that will accomplish the purpose in\nthe most effective and least costly manner.\n\n2. All new buses shall be equipped by September first, 2014.\n\n3. All buses in service shall be equipped by September 1, 2017 (i.e.,\nwill be given a three-year transition window).\n\n4. The district is to conduct a demonstration program in September 1,\n2012-September 1, 2013, involving 5% of buses in service to determine\nthe most effective and least costly means of accomplishing the goal,\nand report to the commissioner, the governor and the legislature on\nthe demonstration program.\n\n5. The system is to be used only as an aid to monitor on-board\nactivities.\n\n6. Records must be stored in a secure location for a period of time\ndesignated by the commissioner, but not for less than go days, unless\n\nthere is a report of an incident, in which case the records shall be\nkept for a period determined by the commissioner.\n\n7. The records are to be reviewed only by designated personnel\npursuant to an incident report and on a regular basis using random\nselection criteria, in order to ensure proper driver and pupil conduct.\n\n8. The commissioner is authorized to waive any provision of the system\nwith respect to the district on a determination that the requirement\nis impracticable, or financially or physically burdensome and\nineffective, or if the district proposes and the commissioner accepts\nan alternate means of achieving the goal.\n\n9. All pupils and all school bus drivers are to be notified by signs\nand any other means prescribed by the commissioner that they are\nsubject to being videotaped on a school bus at any time, and parents\nare to be notified. Drivers, parents and pupils shall be advised what\ndriver conduct and what pupil conduct is prohibited by the state and\nby the district and that such conduct will result in specified\ndisciplinary consequences as defined in the established discipline\npolicy.\n\n10. At least twice each school year notifications regarding electronic\nmonitoring must occur, addressing the purpose and use of electronic\nequipment and the need for personal awareness of safety issues,\nthrough newsletters, pupil handouts, and notices posted within the\nbus, etc.\n\n11. Records are to remain confidential and shall be used only for the\npurpose of disciplinary and enforcement proceedings.\n\nSection 3 amends paragraph c of subdivision 2 of section 3623-a of the\neducation law, to allow the equipping of school buses to be State\naidable.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nThis legislation is the result of a series of shocking revelations\nuncovered by the New York Daily News of sex abuse and violence taking\nplace on school buses. In 2006, 55,000 school buses transported 2.3\nmillion children daily in New York State. School buses carry the\nworld's most precious cargo, and we need to ensure that they provide\na safe and secure environment for our kids. New Yorkers place more\nthan 2 million children on the school bus each morning, and everyone\nof these kids should be able to arrive safely at their destination.\nBy placing cameras on buses and requiring background checks for\nschool bus attendants, we can help keep our kids safe and provide\nparents across the State with greater peace of mind. When a parent\nplaces their child on a school bus each morning, they should be\nsecure in the knowledge that their child will return home safely and\nfree from harm.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2007-08: S.4157E - Referred to Transportation, Local Fiscal Impact\nNote, passed Senate\n2009-10: S.2583 - Referred to Transportation\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n130 days after it becomes law.\n\n",
