  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2599\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to\nestablishing a\npresumption relating to custodial interference\n\nPURPOSE:\nThe bill creates a rebuttable evidentiary\npresumption that\nthe taking of a child in violation of a court order establishing\ncustody or visitation is known by the offender to be a wrongful\ntaking, and that service of such order pursuant to the \"substitute\nservice\" provisions of the Civil Practice Law and Rules shall\nconstitute actual knowledge by the offender of the existence of the\norder.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1, subdivision 1 of the bill amends the\nPenal Law by adding a new section 135.51 providing for presumption of\nservice.\n\nSection 1, subdivision 2 of the bill states that the rebuttable\npresumption established by subdivision one of this section shall not\napply where court order was served by publication.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nCurrent law necessitates personal service.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThere is an increasing recognition among experts of the seriousness of\nparental abduction and its long term negative consequences for\nchildren. The federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency\nPrevention, in its National Incidence Studies on Missing, Abducted,\nRunaway and Thrownaway Children in America (NISMART), reports that\nthere are as many as 354,100 children abducted by a family member\neach year.\n\nForty-six percent of parental abductions in the NISMART study involved\nconcealing the whereabouts of the child or taking the child out of\nthe state. Abduction is often a vengeful attack on the other parent.\nSometimes the abduction is another attempt by the abuser to control,\nintimidate or harass the battered partner attempting to leave the\nrelationship. An abuser may also refuse to return a child after\nvisitation as a form of harassment or a means of continued access to\nthe abused parent. Abductions committed by an abusive parent are more\nlikely to involve violence or the use of force, placing the child in\ngreater jeopardy.\n\nAlthough New York's custodial interference statute seeks to punish\nparental abduction, the law is not comprehensive and is only\nminimally effective. This is due to the difficult threshold needed to\nsecure a felony warrant, as such the warrant requires serving notice.\nUnder the current statute the abductor benefits from his or her\ncriminal conduct by hiding from the law.\n\nIn practice, in order for a victimized parent to access the national\nresources of the FBI, a felony must be charged against the abducting\nparty. In order to establish the \"wrongfulness\" of the taking where\nthe abductor is a parent, the victim (the other parent) must show\nthat the taking violated an order of custody or visitation, or an\norder of protection. Where no prior order exists, the victim must\nobtain an order from a court of appropriate jurisdiction and serve it\nupon the abductor. In cases where the abductor and the child have\nfled, and cannot be located to allow for personal service of the\ncourt's order, the victim is unable to allege a felony and is\ntherefore denied access to the FBI. This is a serious and often\ntragic defect in the current statute, leaving the victim -- the\nrightful custodian -- without the necessary investigative and police\nresources to locate and recover the child, This bill remedies this\ndefect by including the other means of service currently provided for\nin section 307 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n1997-98: S.816B/A.5942C -Passed Senate, Held in Assembly Codes Committee\n1999-00: S.1830/A.4472 - Passed Senate, Held in Assembly Codes Committee\n2001-02: S.4234/A.1862 - Passed Senate, Held in Assembly Codes Committee\n2003-04: S.1923 - Passed Senate\n2005-06: S.466  - Passed Senate\n2007:    S.1076 - Passed Senate\n2008:    S.1076 - Referred to Codes\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nFirst day of November after enactment.\n\n",
