  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1415\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to prostitution offenses and to\nrepeal section 230.07 of the penal law relating thereto\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill would conform the ages of victims in various prostitution\noffenses found in Article 230 of the Penal Law to the ages of victims\nof rape offenses found in Article 130 of the Penal Law.\nThis bill would also raise the penalties for patronizing a prostitute\nin the third, second and first degrees and for promoting prostitution\nin the third degree.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 amends the Penal Law by adding a new section 230.03 which\nprovides that patronizing a prostitute in the fourth degree is a\nclass A misdemeanor.\n\nSection 2 amends section 230.04 of the Penal Law, as amended by\nChapter 74 of the Laws of 2007, by defining patronizing a prostitute\nin the third degree. It provides that a person who is over 21 and\npatronizes a prostitute who is a child under 17 years of age is\nguilty of a class E felony.\n\nSection 3 amends section 230.05 of the Penal Law, as added by Chapter\n627 of the Laws of 1978, by defining patronizing a prostitute in the\nsecond degree. It provides that a person who is 18 or older, and\npatronizes a prostitute who is a child under 15 years of age is\nguilty of a class D felony.\n\nSection 4 amends section 230.06 of the Penal Law, as added by Chapter\n627 of the Laws of 1978, by defining patronizing a prostitute in the\nfirst degree. It provides that a person patronizing a prostitute who\nis a child under 11 years of age, or a person who is 18 years of age\nor older, and patronizes a prostitute who is a child under the age of\n13 is guilty of a class C felony.\n\nSection 5 repeals section 230.07 of the Penal Law.\n\nSection 6 amends section 230.25 of the Penal Law, as added by Chapter\n627 of the Laws of 1978, by defining promoting prostitution in the\nthird degree. It provides that promoting a prostitute under the age\nof 17 years old is a class D felony.\n\nSection 7 amends section 230.30 of the Penal Law, as added by Chapter\n627 of the Laws of 1978, by defining promoting prostitution in the\nsecond degree. It provides that promoting a prostitute under the age\nof 15 years old is a class C felony.\n\nSection 8 amends section 230.32 of the Penal Law, as added by Chapter\n627 of the Laws of 1978, by defining promoting prostitution in the\nfirst degree. It provides that promoting a prostitute under the age\nof 13 years old is a class B felony.\n\nSection 9 amends section 230.33 of the Penal Law, as added by Chapter\n450 of the Laws of 2005, by amending the definition of compelling\nprostitution. It provides that compelling a child under the age of 17\nyears old to engage in prostitution is a is a class B felony.\n\nSection 10 sets forth the effective date as the ninetieth day after it\nshall have become law.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nCurrently, engaging in sex with a child under the age of 15 is\nordinarily a class D felony, but patronizing a prostitute who is\nunder the age of 14 is a class E non-violent felony. Throughout New\nYork State's sex crimes statutes, a child is considered to be a\nperson under the age of 17, but the crime of compelling prostitution\napplies to victims who are less than 16. A defendant who pays for sex\nwith a ten year old child would be charged with patronizing a\nprostitute in the first degree, a class D felony, but if no money is\nexchanged or offered, that same defendant would be charged with\nfirst-degree rape, a class B violent felony.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThere are multiple inconsistencies throughout Penal Law with regard to\nthe ages of victims of crimes of prostitution and certain other sex\ncrimes involving children. This bill would raise the penalty for\npatronizing a prostitute in the first degree to a class C felony, and\nadjust certain other patronizing and promoting crimes. While there\nis, currently, strict liability imposed upon defendants who have sex\nwith children, this legislation would apply the same standard of\nliability to defendants who have sex with child prostitutes.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2008: S.7986 - Passed Senate.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nEffective on the ninetieth day after it shall have become law.\n\n",
