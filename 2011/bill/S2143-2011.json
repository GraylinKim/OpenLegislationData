  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2143\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to establishing the crimes of\nmenacing, assault and\naggravated assault on a judge, district attorney or assistant\ndistrict attorney\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nTo increase criminal penalties when a\nJudge, District Attorney (DA), or Assistant District (ADA) attorney\nis attacked.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nSets forth criminal penalties as follows:\n\n(a) Provides that when a Judge, DA, or ADA is assaulted and subjected\nto serious physical injury that the person (Defendant) is guilty of a\nclass C Felony.\n(b) Provides that when a Judge, DA, or ADA is subjected to serious\nphysical injury and a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument is used,\nthat the person (Defendant) is guilty of a class B Felony.\n(c) Provides that when a Judge, DA, or ADA is placed in fear of injury\nor death by the display of a deadly weapon, knife, pistol, revolver,\nrifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm, and the Defendant knew\nor should have known that the victim was a Judge, DA, or ADA, that\nthe person is guilty of a class D Felony.\n\nEFFECTS OF PRESENT LAW WHICH THIS BILL WOULD ALTER:\nPresently there\nare enhanced criminal penalties for these crimes when the victim is a\npolice officer, firefighter, EMTs. There are not such increased\npenalties for attacks on Judges or DAs or ADAs.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nJudges, DAs, and ADAs perform important services in our\ncriminal justice system (and in the case of Judges, civil justice\nsystem as well). An attack on a Judge or a DA or ADA amounts to an\nattack on the integrity of our judicial system. Any attack on these\nindividuals, who are simply doing their job in the system which all\nAmericans count on for the fair resolution of disputes and actions\nboth civil and criminal, should be met with an increased penalty.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.6229 of 2009: Referred to Codes\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
