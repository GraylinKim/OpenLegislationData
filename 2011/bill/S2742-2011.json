AVELLA -- read twice and ordered printed, and when\n         printed to be committed to the Committee on Environmental Conservation\n\n       AN ACT to amend the environmental conservation  law  and  the  executive\n         law, in relation to global warming pollution control\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Legislative findings. Global warming poses a serious threat\n    2  to the economic well-being, public health, natural resources  and  envi-\n    3  ronment  of  New  York.  The potential adverse impacts of global warming\n    4  include the exacerbation of air quality problems,  a  reduction  in  the\n    5  quality and supply of water to the state, a rise in sea levels resulting\n    6  in the displacement of coastal businesses, residents and infrastructure,\n    7  damage to marine ecosystems and the natural environment, and an increase\n    8  in  the  incidences  of  infectious  diseases,  asthma,  and other human\n    9  health-related problems.  Global warming will have  detrimental  effects\n   10  on  some  of New York's largest industries, including agriculture, tour-\n   11  ism, skiing, recreational and commercial fishing and forestry.\n   12    The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, awarded the 2007  Nobel\n   13  Peace Prize, determined that burning coal, oil and gas has led to higher\n   14  temperatures that are already impacting physical and biological systems.\n   15  The  panel also projected temperatures would rise more rapidly if green-\n   16  house gases are not abated. The panel concluded that reducing  emissions\n   17  80  percent  below  current  emissions  by mid-century would prevent the\n   18  worst impacts of global warming.\n   19    National and international actions are necessary to fully address  the\n   20  issue  of  global  warming. Action taken by New York and other states to\n   21  reduce emissions of greenhouse gases will have far-reaching  effects  by\n   22  encouraging the federal government, and other countries to act including\n   23  encouraging  the  development of sustainable, non-polluting technologies\n   24  such as solar, wind, geothermal and ocean  currents.    New  York  state\n   25  needs  to continue its leadership in addressing global warming; building\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD04318-01-1\n\n       S. 2742                             2\n\n    1  on the progress gained by creating the regional  greenhouse  gas  initi-\n    2  ative. The legislature recognizes the steps taken by the state in moving\n    3  forward  on  the  Renewable  Portfolio Standard (RPS) to generate thirty\n    4  percent  of  our energy needs from renewable sources by 2015, the energy\n    5  efficiency portfolio  standard  to  reduce  electric  usage  by  fifteen\n    6  percent by 2015, and the work of the state climate action plan to reduce\n    7  our greenhouse gas emissions.\n    8    S  2.  Article  19 of the environmental conservation law is amended by\n    9  adding a new title 13 to read as follows:\n   10                                  TITLE 13\n   11                      GLOBAL WARMING POLLUTION CONTROL\n\n   12  SECTION 19-1301.

  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2742\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the environmental conservation law and the executive law,\nin relation to global warming pollution control\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nThe purpose of this bill is to\nrequire the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) to\npromulgate rules and regulations establishing limits on greenhouse\ngas emissions.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThis bill would:\n\no define greenhouse gas to include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous\noxide, hydrofluerocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulfur hexafluroide, and\nany other gas determined by the DEC to be a significant contributor\nto global warming;\n\no authorize the DEC to promulgate rules and regulations, by May\n1, 2011, requiring annual greenhouse gas emission reporting from\ngreenhouse gas emission sources;\n\no require the DEC to issue a report on the annual greenhouse gas\nemissions and the progress made in achieving reduction efforts;\n\no require the DEC, after a public hearing, to promulgate rules and\nregulations establishing a limit on greenhouse gas emissions, require\nthe emissions limit to be less than the aggregate level of emissions\nfor 1990; decrease by an additional twenty percent by 2020 and forty\npercent by 2030;\n\no decrease by a percentage recommended by the climate action council\nand established by the Governor and legislature in 2040; and be less\nthan 80 percent of the initial limit by 2050;\n\no prohibit the DEC from adopting a regulation that would place or\nincrease an additional environmental or health burden on a community\nthat has a higher level of regulated air contaminant source emissions\nwithin the community as compared with the county average;\n\no require the DEC to include a plan to address adaptation to climate\nchange; and,\n\no codifies Executive Order #24 creating a climate action council\nand requiring the development of a climate action plan that is to be\nupdated every five years.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nGlobal warming will have detrimental effects on the economic\nwell-being, public health, natural resources and the environment. The\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, awarded the\n2007 Nobel Peace Prize, projected that temperatures would rise more\nrapidly if greenhouse gases are not abated. The Panel concluded that\nreducing emissions 80 percent below current emissions by mid -century\nwould prevent the worst impacts of global warming. This legislation\nseeks to accomplish that goal and at the same time provide\nopportunity for public involvement and input into the regulatory\nprocess in order to ensure that the resulting emission limits do not\nimpose undue environmental or economic hardship. Seven other states\nhave adopted laws to establish greenhouse gas emission standards.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010: 2009: S.4315-C Thompson - Finance\n2009: S.4315-A Thompson - Finance A.7572-A Sweeney - Passed the Assembly\n2008: S.8100 Thompson - Environmental Conservation A.10302\nSweeney - Passed the Assembly\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
