Legislative intent.  Jerome Park has been used for numerous\n    2  park purposes over the years and is intended to have additional uses  in\n    3  the  future.    Jerome Park was formerly used as a wildlife sanctuary in\n    4  the Harris Park Annex bordering on Goulden  Avenue  north  of  Gatehouse\n    5  Five at the Reservoir and directly across the street from the Bronx High\n    6  School  of  Science.    This area is the future site of an outdoor urban\n    7  ecological study area, an area dedicated to community and school gardens\n    8  and ecology experiments such as composting, wind and rain  precipitation\n    9  measurement,  and  seed and cutting propagation.  It will be accompanied\n   10  by tables and benches for outdoor eating and classroom and lab  instruc-\n   11  tion  sessions.   The Fort Independence Park, part of Jerome Park in the\n   12  northwest side, is presently used, and will continue to be  used,  as  a\n   13  playground,  basketball  and  handball  courts,  running  track,  and an\n   14  archeological-geological mound.  The perimeter of the Jerome Park Reser-\n   15  voir will be the future site of a path for the purposes of  walking  and\n   16  jogging.\n   17    S  2. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of law, that tract of\n   18  land known as Jerome Park  Reservoir,  more  particularly  described  in\n   19  section three of this act, shall be dedicated as parkland of the city of\n   20  New York.\n   21    S 3. The land dedicated as parkland by section two of this act is more\n   22  particularly described as follows:\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD04471-01-1\n\n       A. 1436                             2\n\n    1    All  that  tract or parcel of land situate in the borough of the Bronx\n    2  and the city of New York, bounded and described as follows:\n    3    Beginning  at  a  point  in the westerly line of Goulden Avenue at its\n    4  intersection with the  northerly  line  of  Reservoir  Avenue,  as  said\n    5  streets  are  shown  on Alteration Map No. 56-7 dated February 10, 1919,\n    6  and signed by the Bronx Borough President.\n    7    From the above said point of beginning the following 45 courses:\n    8    1.
