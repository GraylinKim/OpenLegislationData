HASSELL-THOMPSON -- read twice and ordered printed,\n         and when printed to be committed to the Committee on Higher Education\n\n       AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to establishing a  sweat-\n         free  code of conduct for apparel licensed by the colleges and univer-\n         sities of the state  university;  and  to  amend  the  labor  law,  in\n         relation to the special task force for the apparel industry\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as\n    2  the \"ethical business conduct in higher education act\".\n    3    S  2.  Legislative intent. The legislature hereby finds that the state\n    4  university of New York has not responded to decades  old  requests  that\n    5  its  campuses  disaffiliate their business relationships with sweatshops\n    6  in the production and licensing of campus apparel. It is now clear  that\n    7  voluntary action by each campus is no longer an option and that the time\n    8  has come to require a system-wide set of rules and regulations be put in\n    9  place by the chancellor and board of trustees of the state university of\n   10  New York.\n   11    For years, lawmakers, religious and labor groups have criticized state\n   12  university  campus'  affiliations  with  apparel  manufacturers  who are\n   13  indifferent to the fact that  workers  making  university  apparel  face\n   14  abusive  treatment,  excessive  working  hours, dangerous conditions and\n   15  wages that are inadequate to meet basic needs.\n   16    There continues to be  a  strong  demand  that  all  state  university\n   17  campuses  diligently  adopt  sweat-free  standards  in  the  purchase of\n   18  athletic apparel and in the licensing of campus  merchandise.  Advocates\n   19  on  behalf  of working people deplore the repression and exploitation of\n   20  apparel workers in Latin America and elsewhere in the world. The univer-\n   21  sities and colleges of the state   university of New York  should  be  a\n   22  model  for  ethical  business  conduct,  both for their students and the\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD00244-01-1\n\n       S. 975                              2\n\n    1  broader public. It is past time for the state university system adminis-\n    2  tration and all its campuses to affiliate with the sweat-free and worker\n    3  rights work of the Worker Rights Consortium and the Designated  Supplier\n    4  Program  and  end their business relationships that are de facto support\n    5  for sweatshop conditions.\n    6    Presently 60 of the 64 state university campuses have failed  to  take\n    7  the  example  or  lead  of the universities at Albany and Buffalo, which\n    8  have adopted the Designated Supplier Program, and the  colleges  at  New\n    9  Paltz  and  Cortland,  all four of which have affiliated with the Worker\n   10  Rights Consortium to ensure sweat-free manufacturing.\n   11    It is obvious that where there has been strong leadership and  commit-\n   12  ment to protecting worker rights this issue has been resolved.  However,\n   13  we  cannot  wait  indefinitely  for  the  other 60 campuses to engage in\n   14  ethical business behavior that demonstrates  our  national  respect  for\n   15  human rights, worker rights and anti-child labor rights.\n   16    It  is well understood by organized labor, religious organizations and\n   17  social justice groups that the apparel  industry  continues  to  operate\n   18  under  a  paradigm of cost-cutting without respect to human consequence,\n   19  the tragic results of which are the sweatshop conditions that plague the\n   20  supply chains of  university  licensed  apparel.  All  state  university\n   21  campuses  that  have  not already done so must adopt sweat-free codes of\n   22  conduct to which apparel manufacturers producing university apparel must\n   23  adhere.\n   24    It is the findings of the legislature that in order to comprehensively\n   25  remedy this situation it must be  required  that  the  state  university\n   26  administration  put  in  place strict policies for all its campuses with\n   27  regard to how their apparel is manufactured.  It  is  unacceptable  that\n   28  after  all  the years of calls to end such practices, campus administra-\n   29  tors continue to ignore the violations of human rights that  take  place\n   30  in order for their campus apparel to be manufactured and sold.\n   31    S  3. The education law is amended by adding a new section 361 to read\n   32  as follows:\n   33    S 361. SWEAT-FREE CODE OF CONDUCT.  1.   THE CHANCELLOR OF  THE  STATE\n   34  UNIVERSITY  SHALL,  ON  OR  BEFORE  JANUARY  THIRTY-FIRST,  TWO THOUSAND\n   35  TWELVE, DEVELOP AND DRAFT A SWEAT-FREE CODE OF CONDUCT FOR THE  PURCHASE\n   36  AND  LICENSING  OF APPAREL BY STATE-OPERATED INSTITUTIONS. SUCH CODE, TO\n   37  THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE, SHALL MEET OR EXCEED THE  LABOR  STANDARDS,  AND\n   38  BUSINESS AND FACTORY DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ENUMERATED IN WORKER RIGHTS\n   39  CONSORTIUM'S  MODEL  CODE  OF  CONDUCT.  THE  CODE  SHALL  REQUIRE  EACH\n   40  STATE-OPERATED INSTITUTION TO AFFILIATE WITH THE WORKER RIGHTS CONSORTI-\n   41  UM AND PARTICIPATE IN THE DESIGNATED SUPPLIER PROGRAM FOR THE PURPOSE OF\n   42  EFFECTIVELY ENFORCING THE PROVISIONS OF SUCH  CODE.    FURTHERMORE,  THE\n   43  SWEAT-FREE  CODE  OF CONDUCT SHALL PROVIDE THAT EVERY CONTRACT BETWEEN A\n   44  STATE-OPERATED INSTITUTION AND ANY APPAREL MANUFACTURER SHALL INCLUDE  A\n   45  PROVISION  PROVIDING  FOR  THE  TERMINATION  AND  NULLIFICATION  OF SUCH\n   46  CONTRACT UPON ANY FINDING OF A  VIOLATION  OF  THE  SWEAT-FREE  CODE  OF\n   47  CONDUCT  IN FACILITIES THAT SUCH MANUFACTURER OPERATES OR FROM WHOM SUCH\n   48  MANUFACTURER PURCHASES PRODUCTS.   SUCH CODE OF  CONDUCT  SHALL  PROVIDE\n   49  THAT  NOTICE  OF ANY SUCH VIOLATION MAY BE PROVIDED BY THE WORKER RIGHTS\n   50  CONSORTIUM. THE SWEAT-FREE CODE OF CONDUCT SHALL PROVIDE FOR  A  REMEDI-\n   51  ATION  PROCESS WHEREBY ANY SUCH MANUFACTURER MAY BE GRANTED THE OPPORTU-\n   52  NITY TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION PRIOR TO CONTRACT TERMINATION. SUCH REME-\n   53  DIATION PROCESS, TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE, SHALL  REFLECT  THE  PROCESS\n   54  DESCRIBED IN THE MODEL CODE OF CONDUCT OF THE WORKER RIGHTS CONSORTIUM.\n   55    2. SUCH CHANCELLOR SHALL, ON OR BEFORE JANUARY THIRTY-FIRST, TWO THOU-\n   56  SAND TWELVE, SUBMIT TO THE STATE UNIVERSITY TRUSTEES THE CODE OF CONDUCT\n\n       S. 975                              3\n\n    1  DEVELOPED  AND DRAFTED PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION. SUCH\n    2  CODE OF CONDUCT SHALL BE ADOPTED BY THE STATE UNIVERSITY TRUSTEES ON  OR\n    3  BEFORE  MARCH  THIRTIETH,  TWO THOUSAND TWELVE, AS RULES AND REGULATIONS\n    4  APPLICABLE  TO  ALL  STATE-OPERATED INSTITUTIONS.   SUCH RULES AND REGU-\n    5  LATIONS SHALL INCLUDE PROVISIONS FOR THE ENFORCEMENT THEREOF  TO  ENSURE\n    6  FULL COMPLIANCE THEREWITH BY STATE OPERATED INSTITUTIONS.\n    7    3.  ON  OR BEFORE SEPTEMBER FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWELVE, THE CHANCELLOR\n    8  OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY SHALL SUBMIT A PRELIMINARY REPORT TO THE  GOVER-\n    9  NOR AND THE LEGISLATURE WHICH SHALL INCLUDE A LIST OF THE STATE-OPERATED\n   10  INSTITUTIONS WHICH HAVE COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE SWEAT-FREE CODE OF\n   11  CONDUCT,  AND  WHEN ANY PURCHASING AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS WITH APPAREL\n   12  MANUFACTURERS WHICH HAVE FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE  PROVISIONS  OF  SUCH\n   13  CODE  OF  CONDUCT, WILL EXPIRE.  SUCH PRELIMINARY REPORT SHALL INCLUDE A\n   14  LIST OF EACH STATE-OPERATED INSTITUTION THAT  HAS  AFFILIATED  WITH  THE\n   15  WORKER  RIGHTS  CONSORTIUM  AND  PARTICIPATES IN THE DESIGNATED SUPPLIER\n   16  PROGRAM.\n   17    4.

THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE  OFFICER  OF  EACH  STATE-OPERATED  INSTITUTION\n   27  WHICH  HAS  FAILED  TO COMPLY WITH THE CODE OF CONDUCT OR AFFILIATE WITH\n   28  THE WORKER RIGHTS CONSORTIUM AND PARTICIPATE IN THE DESIGNATED  SUPPLIER\n   29  PROGRAM  ON  OR BEFORE MARCH FIRST, TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN, SHALL SUBMIT,\n   30  BY FIRST CLASS MAIL, TO THE GOVERNOR, EACH MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE AND\n   31  EACH MEMBER OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY TRUSTEES A DETAILED  EXPLANATION  OF\n   32  THE  DELAY  IN  COMPLIANCE AND/OR AFFILIATION, AND WHEN FULL COMPLIANCE,\n   33  AFFILIATION AND/OR PARTICIPATION WILL BE COMPLETED.\n   34    6.
