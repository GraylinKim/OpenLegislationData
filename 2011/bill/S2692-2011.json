  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2692\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the education law, in relation to authorizing the city\nuniversity trustees to make courses available for certain persons sixty\nyears of age or over\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\n\nThis bill will permit the trustees of the City University to allow\nsenior citizens to take courses for credit, on a space-available\nbasis, without charge, at State-operated campuses.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\n\nAmends section 6206 of the Education Law to allow a senior to take\ncredit or non-credit courses to a maximum of nine credit hours per\nsemester, on a space available basis, at no charge. Currently,\nseniors are permitted to audit courses without paying tuition. A\nsenior is defined as a person sixty years of age or older.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nIn 1974, New York State took a giant step forward by adopting Chapter\n1002 of the Laws of 1974 permitting senior citizens to audit courses\nat the State University without tuition, examination or credit, on a\nspace available basis. On approving that legislation, the Governor\nnoted that, \"Education can be a major factor in helping older people\nmaintain their mental alertness, (and) continue active participation\nin the affairs of their communities. In many instances, however,\nfinancial and formal educational barriers have rendered such\neducation opportunities inaccessible.\"\n\nAlthough the 1974 law began an important step forward, senior citizens\nhave so far been denied the opportunity to further their education on\na for-credit basis. This bill\nwould extend to persons over age 60 the ability to attend courses at\nno charge at the State University, on a space-available basis, while\nreceiving credit for their course work. This is a logical\ncontinuation of our efforts to integrate our elderly collegians fully\ninto the mainstream of academic life. It is now time to make our\nstudents over age 60 first-class citizens of the University, entitled\nnot only to the privileges of an auditor, but also the opportunities\nof full participation in their course work.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\nS.1821 - Passed Senate Senate 60-1 in 2005 and 2006.\nS.4441 - Referred to Higher Education, Committed to Rules in\n\n2007 and 2008\nS.2019 - Referred to Higher Education in 2009 and 2010\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nThere is no direct fiscal impact, since all attendance would be on a\nspace-available basis.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis act shall take effect on the first of April next succeeding the\ndate on which it shall have become a law.\n\n",
