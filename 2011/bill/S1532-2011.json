  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1532\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the general business law, in relation to the purchase, sale, or\ninstallation of salvaged high-intensity discharge headlamps\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo prevent the illegal purchase, sale or installation of stolen high\ndensity discharge headlamps.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nA new section 398-e is added to the general business law which makes\nit a class E felony to knowingly possess, sell, or install a. stolen\nuninstalled high-intensity discharge (HID) headlamp.\n\nPersons engaged in the business of purchasing, selling, or installing\nsalvaged HID headlamps shall maintain a manual or electronic record\nof the purchase, sale, or installation which will include the\nidentification number of the salvaged headlamp; the vehicle\nidentification number of the vehicle from which it was removed; the\nname, address, and driver's license number or other identification of\nthe person from whom the salvaged HID headlamp was purchased; and, in\nthe event that the salvaged HID headlamp is installed, the VIN of the\nvehicle into which the HID headlamp is installed.\n\nThe record must be retained for 36 months following the transaction\nand may be inspected during normal business hours by any law NYS law\nenforcement officer.\n\nAny person who sells or installs a salvaged HID headlamp must disclose\nto the purchaser or consumer that it is salvaged. The owner or\nproprietor of any business that fails to maintain complete and\naccurate records as required by subdivision two of this section will\nbe guilty of a misdemeanor for such failure.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nHeadlamp theft is becoming as big an epidemic as air bag theft once was.\nThe high intensity discharge headlamps being used in luxury cars axe\ncoveted by teenagers who buy them along with converter kits from\nunscrupulous auto parts dealers. The headlamps can be removed from\nmost cars in under a minute but not without extensive damage to the\nvehicle. It can cost as much as $5,000 to repair such a vandalized car.\n\nIn 1996 New York enacted the Airbag Safety and Anti-Theft Act to stop\nair bag theft by providing that an airbag activated in a crash or one\nthat was stolen could only be replaced by a newly manufactured air bag\nor a salvaged one that was certified by a nationally recognized\nengineering and research body. Now, cars are no longer vandalized for\nair bags.\n\nThis legislation will curtail HID headlamp theft, saving insurance\ncompanies money and the car owner aggravation, wasted time and higher\ninsurance premiums.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n\nThis legislation has beenpreviously introduced.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to the state.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThe first of November after it becomes law.\n\n",
