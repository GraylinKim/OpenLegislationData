  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2712\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the family court act and\nthe social services law, in\nrelation to abandoned infants\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nTo better implement the Abandoned Infant Protection Act of 2000 by\nclarifying certain provisions of the family court act and social\nservices law in order to protect abandoned newborn infants.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nSection one amends section 1012 of the family court act by amending\nparagraph (ii) of subdivision (f) and subdivision (j) and adding a\nnew subdivision (1). Paragraph (ii) of subdivision (f) clarifies that\nthe term \"neglected child\" does not include an abandoned infant as\ndefined subdivision (1) of section 1012 of the family court act.\nSubdivision (j) amends the definition of \"aggravated circumstances\"\nto include where a court has determined a child thirty days or\nyounger was abandoned by a parent with an intent to wholly abandon\nsuch child and with the intent that the child be safe from physical\ninjury and cared for in an appropriate manner.\nNew subdivision (1) defines \"abandoned infant.\"\n\nSection two amends article ten of the family court act by adding a new\nsection 1031-a which outlines the preliminary procedures to be taken\nwhen a child who appears to be an abandoned infant is found. The\ncommissioner of the local social services department shall\nimmediately take protective custody of the infant. The local\ncommissioner of social services (local commissioner) shall commence a\ncourt proceeding at once to determine whether the child is an\nabandoned infant. The information to be included in the petition is\nprovided. Upon receiving the petition, the court shall appoint an\nattorney for the child to represent the alleged abandoned infant. If\nthe parents of the infant are unknown, the court shall upon receipt\nof the petition, hold a hearing to determine whether the child\nappears to have been abandoned in accordance with the definition of\nabandoned infant provided in subdivision (l) of section 1012 of the\nfamily court act. If at the hearing the court determines that the\ncircumstances of the abandonment meet the definition of abandoned\ninfant in said subdivision (1 ), the court shall order that the local\ncommissioner shall not be required to commence a diligent search to\nlocate the parents or other\nrelatives of the child and shall require the local commissioner to\ncause notice of the proceeding to be published in the county in which\nthe infant was found at least once in each of three successive weeks.\nService by publication is complete on the twenty-first day after the\nday of first publication. The information the notice shall contain is\nprovided. In addition, the court, in determining whether removal or\n\ncontinuing the removal of the child is necessary to avoid imminent\nrisk to the child's life or health, shall consider and determine it\nits order whether continuation in the child's home would be contrary\nto the best interests of the child and, where appropriate, whether\nreasonable efforts were made prior to the date of the hearing to\nprevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the home\nand, if the child was removed from his home prior to the date of the\nhearing, where appropriate, that reasonable efforts were made to make\nit possible for the child to safely return home. If the court\ndetermines that reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need\nfor removal of the child from the home were not made but that the\nlack of such efforts was appropriate under the circumstances, the\ncourt order shall include such\nfinding.\n\nIn the event that a person claiming to be the parent of the infant\ncomes forward, the local commissioner of social services shall\nimmediately provide written notification to both the court and the\nassigned attorney for the child and cause a test to be conducted to\nconfirm maternity or paternity. If maternity or paternity is confirmed,\nthe local commissioner shall notify the court, which shall order an\ninvestigation pursuant to section 1034(1) of the family court act.\nThe existing order of custody of the child to the local commissioner\nshall continue pending the result of the investigation. If there are\ngrounds pursuant to subdivision (e) or (f) of section 1012 of the\nfamily court act to file a petition to determine abuse or neglect\npursuant to section 1031 of the family court act, the local\ncommissioner shall file such petition within three court days of the\ncompletion of the investigation. The parent or parents shall be\ninformed of the date and the time that the petition shall be filed,\nthe address of the court where the petition shall be filed, the right\nof the parent to be present at any hearing held and the right to be\nrepresented by counsel. Upon such filing, a hearing pursuant to\nsection 1027 of the family court act shall be held\nforthwith. If no such grounds exist, the court shall dismiss the\npetition to determine whether the infant is an abandoned infant and\norder that the child be returned to his or her parent or parents.\n\nSection three amends subdivision (a) of section 1039-b of the family\ncourt act, as added by chapter 7 of the laws of 1999, regarding the\nfiling by the social services official of a motion requesting a\nfinding that reasonable efforts to return an abandoned infant to his\nor her home are no longer required.\n\nSection four amends subdivision (a) of section 1041 of the family\ncourt act, as amended by chapter 1015 of the laws of 1972, by\nproviding that when a child is alleged to be an abandoned infant, a\nparent or person legally responsible for such child does not have to\nappear in court nor shall it be necessary to serve such person with a\ncopy of the petition, but the provisions of section 1031-a(d)(1)(3)\nshall apply.\n\nSection five amends section 1044 of the family court act to provide\nthat the definition of \"fact finding hearing\" includes a hearing to\ndetermine whether a child is an abandoned infant as defined in the\nfamily court act.\n\nSection six amends the family court act by adding a new section\n1051-a to provide that in a fact finding hearing, the court shall\ndetermine that the child is an abandoned infant if facts sufficient\nto constitute clear and convincing evidence are established to find\nthat the child was thirty days old or younger when abandoned and that\nthe child was left in a manner that indicated the parent's intent to\nwholly abandon such child by relinquishing and foregoing\nresponsibility for and rights to the care and custody of such child\nwith the intent that the child be safe from physical injury and cared\nfor in an appropriate manner. Sufficient evidence of the child's age\nand date of birth and intent to wholly abandon the child are: an\naffidavit or other official record of determination of a qualified\nhealth care practitioner who examined the child that such child was\nthirty days old or younger when abandoned and the date of birth of\nthe child to a reasonable degree of certainty;\nan affidavit or official record, including a police report or\ntestimony regarding the manner of abandonment of the child; and an\naffidavit or official record of the result of inquiries made to the\nputative father registry and to local law enforcement officials\nregarding a missing person report.\nIf the court sustains the petition and finds that the child is an\nabandoned infant, the court shall make a finding and issue a court\norder that includes certain information as outlined in the bill.\nShould the facts be insufficient to sustain the petition, the court\nshall convert the petition to a proceeding to determine abuse or\nneglect pursuant to section 1031 of the family court act and shall\nstate on the record the grounds for conversion. The court shall\ndetermine whether temporary custody of the child to the local\ncommissioner of social services shall continue until further order of\nthe court. In determining whether removal or continuing the removal\nof the child is necessary to avoid imminent risk to the child's life\nor health, the court shall consider and determine in its order\nwhether continuation in the child's home would be contrary to the\nbest interests of the child and, where appropriate, whether\nreasonable efforts were made prior to the date of the hearing to\nprevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the home\nand, if the child was removed from his home prior to the date of the\nhearing, where appropriate, that reasonable efforts were made to make\nit possible for the child to safely return home. If the\ncourt determines that reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the\nneed for removal of the child from the home were not made but that\nthe lack of such efforts was appropriate under the circumstances, the\ncourt order shall include such finding.\n\nThe court shall commence a dispositional hearing immediately after the\nfact-finding hearing when the petition has been sustained and enter\nan order of disposition that includes certain information as outlined\n\nin the bill, including placing the child in the custody of the local\ncommissioner, who shall make reasonable efforts to place the child\ninto a pre-adoptive home. The local commissioner shall be required to\ncommence a proceeding to commit the guardianship and custody of the\ninfant to an authorized agency within sixty days and if the initial\npermanency hearing has not been held, to set a date certain for an\ninitial permanency hearing.\n\nSection seven amends paragraph (i) of subdivision (a) of section 1055\nof the family court act, as amended by section 12 of part G of\nchapter 58 of the laws of 2010, by adding that when custody is being\ndetermined for an abandoned infant, the court may place the child in\nthe custody of certain named persons or a duly authorized\nassociation, agency, society or institution suitable for the\nplacement of a child.\n\nSection eight amends paragraph (ii) of subdivision (b) of section 1055\nof the family court act, as amended by section 18 of part A of\nchapter 3 of the laws of 2005, by providing that a diligent\nsearch of the child's parents is not necessary if it has been\ndetermined that such child is an abandoned infant.\n\nSection nine amends subparagraph (i) of paragraph 1 of subdivision (b)\nof section 1089 of the family court act, as amended by chapter 437 of\nthe laws of 2006, by providing that the requirement to serve notice\non the parents of a child does not apply when such child has been\nalleged or found to be an abandoned infant and the identity of the\nparent or parents is unknown.\n\nSection ten amends subdivision (b) of section 1089 of the family court\nact. by adding new paragraphs 3 and 4. New paragraph 3 provides that\nwhere a child who is not free for adoption has been alleged or found\nto be an abandoned infant and the identity of such infant's parents\nis not known, the local commissioner of social services shall cause\nnotice of the permanently hearing for an abandoned infant to be\npublished in the county in which such child was found.\nThe notice shall contain certain information as provided in the bill.\nNew paragraph 4 provides that if, within six months after the initial\npublication of notice of a proceeding to determine whether a child is\nan abandoned infant, a person claiming to be the mother or father of\nan infant who has been alleged or found to be an abandoned infant\ncomes forward and the maternity or paternity of such person is\nconfirmed by a test to confirm maternity or paternity, the court\nshall order an investigation pursuant to section 1 034( 1) of the\nfamily court act. If there are grounds pursuant to subdivision (e) or\n(f) of section 1012 of the family court act to file a petition to\ndetermine abuse or neglect pursuant to section 1031 of the family\ncourt act, the, local commissioner shall file such petition within\nthree court days. Upon such filing, a hearing pursuant to section\n1027 of the family court act shall be held forthwith. If no such\ngrounds exist, the court shall hold a best interests hearing as to\nwhether it is in the best interests of the child to return the child\n\nto the child's home or to continue the custody of the child with the\nlocal commissioner. Except for good cause shown, such hearing shall\nbe commenced within three court days. Th\ne custody of the child with the local commissioner shall continue\npending the result of the best interests hearing. If maternity or\npaternity is confirmed and the child is free for adoption, the court\nshall vacate the order committing guardianship and custody of the\nchild.\n\nSection eleven amends section 352 of the social services law by adding\na new subdivision 4 which provides that the requirement to locate the\nparents of a child does not apply when such child is an abandoned\ninfant.\n\nSection twelve adds a new paragraph (g) to subdivision 1 of section\n352-a of the social services law relating to non-marital children. New\nparagraph (g) provides that when such child is an abandoned infant\nthere shall be no requirement to establish paternity nor to locate\nthe parents of such infant.\n\nSection thirteen amends subdivision 2 of section 371 of the social\nservices law, as amended by chapter 666 of the laws of 1976, and adds\na new subdivision 2-a.

If at\nany time prior to or subsequent to the entry of an order committing\nthe guardianship and custody of the child pursuant to section 384-b\nof the social services law but not later than six months after the\ninitial publication of notice of a proceeding pursuant to section 1\n031-a of the family court act, the maternity or paternity of a person\nclaiming to be the mother or father of the abandoned infant is\nconfirmed by a test to be conducted to confirm maternity or\npaternity, the proceeding shall be stayed pending an investigation\npursuant to section 1034(1) of the family court\nact.

The office of\nchildren and family services shall develop and implement the public\ninformation program within amounts appropriated or available by the\nstate.\n\nSection twenty-two provides the effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nCurrently, all fifty states have laws, often termed Safe Haven or Baby\nMoses legislation, to protect infants who are safely abandoned. In\n2000, New York enacted the Abandoned Infant Protection Act (the Act)\nin order to allow a person to safely abandon an infant not more than\nfive days old with an appropriate person or in a suitable location\nwithout the fear of criminal prosecution. Enacted to prevent\ninfanticides throughout the state, the 2000 Act amended the social\nservices law to require the Office of Children and Family Services\n(OCFS) to develop and implement a public information program to\ninform the general public of the new law. When originally enacted,\nthe Act also amended the penal law to provide an affirmative defense\nto criminal prosecution for both the felony crime of abandonment of a\nchild and the misdemeanor crime of endangering the welfare of a child\n\nwhere a person leaves an infant not more than five days old with an\nappropriate person or in a suitable location and promptly notifies an\nappropriate person of the child's location and does so with the\nintent that the child be safe from physical injury and cared for in\nan appropriate manner. The penal law was amended in 2010 to eliminate\ncriminal liability altogether where a person leaves an infant with an\nintent to wholly abandon the child by relinquishing responsibility\nfor and rights to the care and custody of the child, with the intent\nthat the child be safe from physical injury and cared for in an\nappropriate manner, and leaves the infant with an appropriate person\nor in a suitable location and promptly notifies an appropriate person\nof the child's location, and the child is not more than thirty days\nold.\n\nThe Act, however, made no changes to the family court act or to the\nsocial services law.\nTherefore, under current law, a local social services district is\nstill required to search for the parents of the abandoned infant and\nbring them before the court in an abandonment proceeding.\nThis leads to the unintended consequence of parents who fear being\nidentified abandoning their babies in an unsafe manner, leading to\ninjury to, and sometimes the death of, the infants. In addition,\nwhile attempts are made to identify the infant's parents, abandoned\ninfants languish in foster care while the filing of a petition to\nterminate parental rights and to free the infant for adoption is\ndelayed.\n\nThis legislation seeks to amend the relevant provisions in social\nservices law and the family court act to provide for the safe and\nanonymous abandonment of an infant thirty days or younger, increased\nfrom five days or younger, as is provided under penal law. In\naddition, the bill will amend social services law and the family\ncourt act to provide that upon a court determination that a child\nappears to have been abandoned in accordance with the definition of\nan abandoned infant, the local commissioner of social services shall\nnot be required to determine the identity of the person who abandons\nan infant as provided and to set forth the process that must be taken\nby local social services districts to proceed with termination of\nparental rights proceedings and permanency hearings.\n\nThis legislation protects parental rights by providing a mechanism\nthrough which a parent may come forward to establish maternal or\npaternal rights at any time after abandonment until six months after\nthe first publication of the notice of the proceeding to determine\nwhether a child is an abandoned infant. The bill requires that upon\nreceipt of notice that a child who appears to be an abandoned infant\nhas been found, the local commissioner of social services shall\ncommence a proceeding to determine whether a child is an abandoned\ninfant. If the identity of the parents of the child is unknown, the\ncourt must first hold a hearing to determine whether the child\nappears to have been abandoned in accordance with the definition of\nan abandoned infant. If at such hearing the court determines that the\n\ncircumstances of the abandonment meet the definition of abandoned\ninfant, the court shall require the local commissioner to cause\nnotice through publication in a newspaper in each of three successive\nweeks in the county in which the child was found that an abandoned\ninfant was found, the date, time and place the abandoned infant was\nfound, a description of the infant including the approximate date of\nbirth, and that if a parent\ndoes not appear at the proceeding the child may be deemed an abandoned\ninfant and placed into the custody of the local commissioner. In\naddition, the local commissioner is required to publicize the\nabandonment of the child through local media outlets and specifically\nin the community where the abandonment occurred. Furthermore, in\norder to sustain a petition alleging that a child is an abandoned\ninfant, inquiries must have been made to the putative father registry\nand to local law enforcement officials regarding a missing person\nreport. It should be noted, however, that in the ten years since the\nAct was passed, we have learned that attempts at reunification of the\nparent with the abandoned infant is most often not in the best\ninterest of that infant.\n\nBy increasing the age of an infant who is abandoned from five days or\nyounger to thirty days or younger, the legislation provides a parent\nmore time to consider whether to abandon his or her child and also to\ncome forward to establish parental rights should he or she have\nsecond thoughts after abandoning the child. Increasing the age will\nalso make the age at which an infant is considered to be safely\nabandoned under civil law consistent with the age at which an infant\nis considered to be safely abandoned under criminal law and which\nallows the abandoning parent not to be subject to criminal prosecution.\n\nWithout amending current law, local social services districts will\ncontinue to search for the parent who abandons his or her child,\ncausing parents to fear being identified. That fear serves only to\ndiscourage a woman from safely abandoning her infant. When a woman\nwants to abandon her infant but fears not just prosecution, but also\nserious repercussions from family or perhaps even an abusive spouse,\nor deportation, she is more likely to abandon her infant in a way\nthat results in injury to, or even a tragic death for, that infant.\n\nFurthermore, if a woman has concealed her pregnancy from the father,\nher family, school or employer, she may attempt to give birth without\nthe assistance of a physician or other health care practitioner under\nless than optimal conditions, thereby endangering her own health and\nsafety.\n\nIn 2006, in the New York City area alone, twice as many dead newborns\nwere found abandoned as in the preceding year. Moreover, it is not\nonly confusing but also misleading to conduct a public information\nprogram that \"offers hope\" to a mother and her baby, announcing that\na woman can safely abandon her baby \"anonymously\" when in fact\ncurrent law requires social service districts to search for the\nparent who abandoned the child and subjects such parent to a neglect\n\nproceeding when found. We have inadvertently set a trap for parents\nwho feel compelled to abandon their babies and want to do so in a\nsafe manner, and at the same time made it practically impossible for\nparents to abandon their babies in a safe manner if they want to\nremain anonymous. In fact, because social services districts are\nrequired by law to search for the abandoning parents and do so with\nthe assistance of law enforcement, including by questioning hospital\nphysicians and other personnel, it has been reported that hospital\nphysicians and staff are no longer willing to assist pregnant women\nwith their births because they fear being interrogated by law\nenforcement conducting an investigation into the abandonment of a\nchild and being compelled, under threat of prosecution,\nto disclose the identity of a mother or other information\nrelating to the birth of her baby. It is incongruous to provide on\nthe one hand that a mother who safely abandons her child may not be\nsubject to criminal prosecution, yet is sought and if found,\nsubject to a comprehensive series of intrusive civil proceedings.\nDiscovery of the abandoning mother's identity may also endanger the\nsafety of the mother.\n\nA recent case highlights this catch-22 faced by mothers. Last summer,\na newborn baby was found inside a shoe box, abandoned in the lobby of\nan apartment building in Hempstead, New York. Although it appears\nthat the parent of the newborn intended to leave the baby safely and\nanonymously, her attempt at anonymity has been thwarted and precisely\nwhat the mother likely feared has occurred: she became the subject of\na very public media campaign requesting information about her. It\ncannot be denied that the public search for the mother in Hempstead\nwill serve as a stark illustration for pregnant women of what is in\nstore for them should they want, to safely abandon their babies. It\nthen becomes less difficult to imagine why a woman, who does not want\nor feels she cannot keep her newborn, might believe she has no choice\nother than to abandon her baby in a place or in a manner in which her\nidentity cannot be traced, i.e. in a dumpster or an alley.\n\nBy clarifying that social services districts need not, after\nprocedural safeguards have been met, search for a parent who safely\nabandons his or her child or reunite the abandoned infant with his or\nher parent before proceeding with a permanency plan for that infant,\nwe will better achieve the goal of protecting the safety and welfare\nof such infants. Moreover, we will encourage women to give birth\nsafely, thereby ensuring the health and safety of the mothers.\n\nThere have been one hundred eighteen babies who have been safely\nabandoned pursuant to the Act and one hundred twelve adoptions of\nthose babies since the law passed in 2000. (\"Parents in Crisis Have\nMany Options for Giving Babies Haven Officials Say\" by Tina Kelley,\nMarch 5, 2008, The New York Times.) The Act was enacted to save the\nlives of unwanted, newborn infants. This legislation furthers the\nintent of the Act and facilitates its implementation by removing\nunintended barriers to its use, as well as enables the earlier\nplacement of abandoned infants in a permanent home.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2007-2008: Similar to S.7983 - Referred to Judiciary, Advanced to\nThird Reading.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATION:\nPositive impact on both the state and local social services districts.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after it\nshall have become law.\n\n",
