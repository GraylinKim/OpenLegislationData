  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2167\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the elder law, in relation to consumer directed personal\nassistance services\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThis bill amends section 214 of the elder law\n(the State Office for the Aging statutes), by adding a new\nsubdivision 8, Consumer-Directed Personal Assistance Service Provider.\n\n(a) Makes SOFA a participating provider for the purposes of providing\nconsumer directed personal assistance services, and makes the\nfollowing further modifications concerning services provided by or\nthrough the office: \"eligible individual\" is an individual aged sixty\nor older who is eligible for long term care and services provided by\na certified home health agency, long term home health care program or\nAIDS home care program, or is eligible for personal care services; or\neligible for medical assistance; or has been determined by the social\nservices district as being in need of home care services or private\nduty nursing; \"participating provider\" means SOFA, its contractors,\nand any intermediary service organization. The section provides a\nnumber of models under which services may be provided.\n\n(b) Requires SOFA to file within 120 days an application for a federal\n1115 waiver and requires other agencies to comply with any request\nfor the filing of such waiver if SOFA lacks authority to file itself.\nFurther requires SOFA to seek to include and provide a seamless\nnetwork of other services provided through the office where\nappropriate. Establishes principles for the provision of services,\nincluding the principle that individuals have the primary authority\nto make choices that work best for them, regardless of the nature or\nextent of their disability or the source of payment for services.\n\n(c) Allows SOFA to waive State rules and regulations which inhibit its\nability to provide services, so long as such waiver is consistent\nwith any federal waiver granted pursuant to Section 1115 of the\nSocial Security Act or any successor thereto.\n\n(d) Requires SOFA to expand source of payment for the program,\nincluding payments from voluntary and willing private sources,\ninsurance plans, charities and foundations, and individuals.\n\n(e) Permits SOFA to provide or contract for consumer-directed services\non a statewide basis, but requires the office to coordinate services\nwith any current provider of consumer directed services. Prohibits a\nstate agency from imposing a limitation on the number of eligible\nindividuals served.\n\n(f) Establishes that the consumer-directed program by SOFA shall not\nbe subject to audit, assessment, suspension, sanction, or report by\na state agency, except that it shall be subject to audit by the\noffice of the state comptroller to the extent that such programs\nwould have been subject to audit but for this paragraph.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe consumer-directed personal assistance services\nprogram is a marvelous and flexible way of providing services to\nindividuals, however it is not firmly established with the senior\nnetwork, and the range of options and benefits has not been fully\nexploited in New York. This legislation serves several goals: by\nmaking SOFA a provider, it will bring the program fully into the\nsenior services network, and by running this part of the program\nunder an 1115 waiver, the program will achieve maximum flexibility.\nNew York has used Medicaid waivers to reorient the state's health\ncare spending away from inpatient facilities towards delivery\nsystems focused on outpatient and primary care.  Through this\nlegislation, we can expand this efficient system to seniors.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.457 -  2007-08 - Aging\nS.1592 - 2009-10 - Aging\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
