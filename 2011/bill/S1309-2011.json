In many cases such housing has fallen into  disrepair  or  is\n    5  being  lost  as  affordable housing due to statutory provisions allowing\n    6  owners to dissolve housing companies.  The  unmet  need  for  affordable\n    7  housing  is presently greater than at any time in the state's history. A\n    8  temporary moratorium on the dissolution of any housing company is neces-\n    9  sary for the New York state division of housing and community renewal to\n   10  complete its work and make recommendations.\n   11    S 2.

  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1309\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nauthorizing the New York state division of housing and community\nrenewal\nto study state and locally aided\nhousing programs and make recommendations for the preservation,\nmodernization, and increase in the supply of such housing; to amend the\nprivate housing finance law, in relation to providing a moratorium on\nthe voluntary dissolution of limited profit, limited dividend\nand redevelopment housing\ncompanies; and\nproviding for the repeal of certain provisions upon the expiration\nthereof\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis legislation would establish a temporary moratorium, expiring at\nthe end of 2012, on the dissolution of any state or locally aided\nhousing company, without the consent. This moratorium would enable\nthe NYS Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) to complete\nits work and make recommendations\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSections 2, 3 and 4 requires DHCR to conduct a study of state and\nlocally funded low and middle income housing programs. The DHCR is\nrequired to report back to the Governor and the Legislature within\none year with its findings, conclusions and recommendations and\npropose legislation to implement its recommendations. Including those\nthat currently allow housing companies to withdraw from programs.\n\nSection 5 amends Section 35 of the private housing finance law by\nadding a new subdivision 5 which provides that notwithstanding any\nprovision of this section, no company shall be voluntarily dissolved\nwithout the consent of the commissioner or supervising agency, as the\ncase may be, until December 31, 2012.\n\nSection 6 amends Section 96 of the private housing finance law by\nadding subdivision 3 which provides that notwithstanding any other\nprovisions of this section, no company shall be voluntarily dissolved\nor terminated, without the consent of the commissioner until December\n31, 2012.\n\nSection 7 amends Section 96 of the private housing finance law to\nprovide that notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no\ncompany shall be voluntarily dissolved or terminate without the\nconsent of the local legislative body until December 31, 2012.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nNew York State is in th th e roes of an affordable housing crisis, with\nthe unmet need for affordable housing presently greater than at any\n\ntime in the state's history. Among other factors fueling the erosion\nof our affordable housing stock is the fact that thousands of\nMitchell-Lama and other state and locally aided, limited equity\ncooperative and rental apartments are facing extinction.\n\nFor more than a half a century, New York State and its localities have\ninvested in the creation of low and middle income housing to benefit\nthose most in need, as well as to benefit state and local economies.\nHowever, in many cases, such housing has fallen into disrepair or is\nbeing rendered unaffordable due to statutory provisions allowing owners\n\nto dissolve such housing companies without reimbursing the government\nfor the enhanced value made possible by its contributions.\n\nThis legislation would establish a temporary moratorium, expiring at\nthe end of 2012, on the dissolution of any state or locally aided\nhousing company, without governmental consent. This moratorium would\nenable the DHCR to complete its work and make recommendations to the\nLegislature.\n\nWhen the moratorium it establishes expires, New York State will have a\nblueprint for the preservation, modernization, and expansion of such\naffordable developments now and into the future.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010: S2171/A9969 (Died in Senate Housing/Died in Assembly Housing)\n2009: S2171/A6706 (Died in Senate Rules/Died in Assembly Housing)\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately, with provisions.\n\n",
