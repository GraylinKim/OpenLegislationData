  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2323\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act to amend the social services law, in relation to clarifying the\ndefinitions of vocational educational training and educational activ-\nities\n\nPURPOSE OF THE BILL:\nThe bill would amend the social Services Law (SSL) to allow attendance\nin up to four years of post-secondary education to count toward, an\nindividual's public assistance employment requirement where the attend-\nance is consistent with the individual's employment and assessment plan\ngoals, and make corresponding changes to income and resource exemptions\nfor monies set aside for paying' for education.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 of the bill would amend SSL &sect; 335 (a) to match with the corre-\nsponding law in &sect;335-a.\n\nSections 2 and 3 of the bill would amend SSL &sect; 336(1) (h) and (1) (i) to\ninclude up to four years of postsecondary education in the definition of\n\"vocational educational training.\"\n\nSection 4 of the bill would amend SSL &sect; 336-a(1) to allow for up to four\nyears of postsecondary education to count as participation for purposes\nof an individual's public assistance employment requirement and provide\nthat all assignments to vocational educational training and educational\nactivities will be permitted only to the extent that such an assignments\nconsistent with an individual's assessment and employment plan.\n\nSection 5 of the bill would amend SSL &sect;131-n(1)(c), which provides that\nup to $1,400 maybe kept in a separate bank account and deemed exempt and\ndisregarded in calculating the amount of public assistance benefits\nwhere the funds are to be used for payment of tuition at a two-year\naccredited post-secondary institution, to add an accredited four-year\ninstitution.\n\nSection 6 of the bill would provide for an immediate effective date,\nprovided that the amendments to paragraph (c) of subdivision 1 of\nsection 131-n of the social services law made by section five of this\nact shall not affect the expiration of such section and shall be deemed\nto expire therewith.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nSSL &sect;&sect; 336 and 336-a currently provide that a public assistance recipi-\nent may be assigned no more than two years of post-secondary education\nas part of public assistance employment activities.\n\nSSL &sect; 131-n(1)(c) currently provides that up to $1,400 may be kept in a\nseparate bank account and deemed exempt and disregarded in calculating\nthe amount of public assistance benefits where the funds are to be used\n\nfor payment of tuition at a two year accredited post-secondary institu-\ntion.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.5846-B; Died in Finance\n\nSTATEMENT IN SUPPORT:\nThis bill would permit social service districts to exercise the flexi-\nbility permitted by recent changes to the federal regulations in the\nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families program (TANF). The Personal\nResponsibility and Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of\n1996 required states to meet certain work participation rates for recip-\nients o.f assistance funded by the TANF program or face severe fiscal\npenalties. The federal law and implementing regulations specified which\nkinds of work activities counted towards meeting the work participation\nrate. Participation in a four year college program was not a countable\nactivity. State law, SSL &sect;330 et seq., mirrored the federal requirements\nin imposing work obligations on public assistance recipients and not\npermitting participation in a four-year college program to count towards\nthat requirement.\n\nChanges in federal regulations in response to the federal Deficit\nReduction Act of 2005 (Pub.L. 109-171) now permit states to count four-\nyear college attendance by recipients toward the work participation\nrequirements in certain circumstances. The changes proposed by this bill\nwould permit New York to take advantage of this federal change which\nwould, benefit both recipients and social services districts. While a\nfour-year college degree may not be a viable option for many public\nassistance recipients, for whom there exists an array of services and\nprograms, a four-year diploma is a realistic goal for some recipients.\n\nFor those recipients, a college diploma is a proven way out of poverty\nand an important tool in staying off assistance. This is particularly\ntrue for recipients who were already attending college when the current\nspell of neediness occurred. This would alleviate concerns that a recip-\nient would have to drop out of college in order to perform his or her\npublic assistance work requirements to maintain necessary assistance.\n\nThe bill will also benefit social services districts. It will give them\none more option in fashioning a program for public assistance recipi-\nents. It will also help them meet work participation requirements. The\nbill does not require districts to approve every recipient for attend-\nance in a four-year college. Instead, it permits a district to consider\nsuch activity for its local employment plan and to make individual\nassignments consistent with its evaluation and assessment of employabil-\nity.\n\nConsistent with the general purpose of permitting four-year colleges as\na permissible work activity, the bill would amend section SSL &sect; 131-n,\nwhich specifies income and resources an applicant or recipient of public\nassistance may have and still be eligible for assistance.  Currently, an\napplicant or recipient can maintain up to $1,400 in a bank account for\n\nthe purpose of paying for a two-year secondary education. Without chang-\ning the amount, this bill would permit a person to maintain an account\nfor a four year secondary education.  The bill also provides that any\nassignment to any vocational educational training or educational activ-\nity will be permitted only to the extent that it is consistent with the\nindividual's assessment and employment plan goals. This provision\nreflects the goals of the assessments and employability plans as set\nforth in SSL &sect; 335 and &sect; 335-a and the State's policy of meeting the\neducational needs of public assistance recipients in order to enhance\ntheir employment opportunities.\n\nBUDGET IMPLICATIONS:\nIt is anticipated that this bill would have a minimal fiscal impact.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis bill would become effective immediately; provided, however, that\nthe amendments to paragraph (c) of subdivision 1 of section 131-n of the\nsocial services law made by section five of this act shall not affect\nthe expiration of such section and shall be deemed to expire therewith.\n\n",
