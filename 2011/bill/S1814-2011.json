  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1814\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the social services law, in relation to imposing a ninety day\nresidency requirement for eligibility for medical assistance\n\nPURPOSE AND JUSTIFICATION:\nThis bill would impose a ninety-day state\nresidency requirement for eligibility for Medicaid program services.\nNew York has one of the most generous Medicaid programs in the United\nStates. People from other states have taken advantage of this state's\ngenerosity towards it residents and purposefully moved to New York\nsolely for the benefit of its charitable social programs. Imposing a\nninety-day state residency requirement before allowing individuals to\nqualify for New York's Medicaid program would discourage individuals\nfrom moving to the state solely for the purpose of receiving Medicaid\nwhile preserving Medicaid services for the people who have made New\nYork their home.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 - amends Sec. 117 of the Social Services Law by adding a new\nsubdivision 4 to impose a ninety-day state residency requirement for\neligibility for Medicaid.\n\nSection 2 - Effective date.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010:-     S.6863/A.6779 - SOC. SERV/Soc. Serv;\n2007-08:   A.4672\n2005-06:   A.5463\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined. Cost savings to both counties\nand state are expected.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the 120th day after it\nshall have become law.\nEffective immediately, the commissioner of Health is authorized to\npromulgate any and all rules and regulations and take any other\nmeasures necessary to implement this act on its effective date on or\nbefore such date.\n\n",
