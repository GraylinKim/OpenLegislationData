If the state board is to certify the results\nof all members of the state committee and judicial nominating\nconventions, the tabulated statements of votes cast for all of these\noffices, even those wholly contained within the county, should be\nprovided to the state board of elections.\n\nFISCAL IMPACT:\nUnknown.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
