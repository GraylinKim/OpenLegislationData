If there is only one possible total amount of\n   53  calories, then this total shall be disclosed.\n   54    5.  For  purposes  of subdivision 3 of this section, the disclosure of\n   55  calorie content information on a menu or menu board next to  a  standard\n\n       S. 1131                             4\n\n    1  menu  item that is not an appetizer or dessert, but is intended to serve\n    2  more than one individual, shall include both of the following:\n    3    (a)  The  number  of individuals intended to be served by the standard\n    4  menu item.\n    5    (b) The calorie content information per  individual  serving.

For  beverage  items,  a range of calorie count information may be\n   13  provided, which includes both the minimum amount  of  calories  for  any\n   14  beverage item and the maximum amount of calories.\n   15    7.    The  nutritional  information  and  calorie  content information\n   16  required by this act shall  be  determined  on  a  reasonable  basis.  A\n   17  reasonable  basis  determination  of nutritional information and calorie\n   18  content information shall be required only once per standard menu  item,\n   19  provided that portion size is reasonably consistent and the food facili-\n   20  ty  follows  a  standardized recipe and trains to a consistent method of\n   21  preparation.\n   22    8. Menus and menu boards may include a disclaimer that indicates  that\n   23  there may be variations in nutritional content across servings, based on\n   24  variations  in  overall size and quantities of ingredients, and based on\n   25  special ordering.\n   26    9. This act shall not be construed to create  or  enhance  any  claim,\n   27  right  of action, or civil liability that did not previously exist under\n   28  state law or limit any claim, right of action, or civil  liability  that\n   29  otherwise exists under state law. No private right of action shall arise\n   30  out of this act. The only enforcement mechanism of this act shall be the\n   31  local enforcement agency.\n   32    10. This act shall not be construed to preclude any food facility from\n   33  voluntarily   providing  nutritional  information  in  addition  to  the\n   34  requirements of this act.\n   35    11. To the extent consistent with federal law, this act,  as  well  as\n   36  any  other state law that regulates the disclosure of nutritional infor-\n   37  mation, is a matter of statewide concern and occupies the whole field of\n   38  regulation regarding the disclosure of nutritional information by a food\n   39  facility as well as content required to be posted on menus, menu  boards\n   40  and  food  item  tags.  No ordinance or regulation of a local government\n   41  shall regulate the  dissemination  of  nutritional  information  or  the\n   42  content required to be placed on menus, menu boards or food item tags by\n   43  a food facility. Any ordinance or regulation that violates this prohibi-\n   44  tion is void and shall have no force or effect.\n   45    12. Commencing July 1, 2012, a food facility that violates this act is\n   46  guilty  of  an  infraction,  punishable by a fine of not less than fifty\n   47  dollars or more than five hundred dollars, which may be  assessed  by  a\n   48  local  enforcement  agency. However, a food facility may not be found to\n   49  violate this act more than once during an inspection  visit.    Notwith-\n   50  standing  the penal law or any other provision of law to the contrary, a\n   51  violation of this act shall not constitute a misdemeanor.\n   52    13. Within 180 days after the effective date of this act, the New York\n   53  state department of health shall  promulgate  regulations  defining  the\n   54  specific  requirements  that constitute substantial compliance with this\n   55  act by food facilities.\n\n       S. 1131                             5\n\n    1    14. If any provision of this act or the application thereof is for any\n    2  reason held invalid, ineffective, or  unconstitutional  by  a  court  of\n    3  competent  jurisdiction, the remainder of this act shall not be affected\n    4  thereby, and to this end, the provisions of this act are severable.\n    5    S 3. This act shall take effect immediately.\n",
