  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2184\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the executive law, in relation to the appearance of certain\nlaw enforcement officers at parole hearings\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo allow police chiefs to speak at parole hearings.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection one amends subparagraph (A) of paragraph (c) of subdivision\n(2) of section 259-1 of the executive law, to add the ability of a\npolice chief to provide a written or oral statement concerning the\npolice agency's experience with the inmate. The wording leaves it to\nthe chief to determine what is appropriate to share with the board.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nExisting law does not require or allow the police chief to make a\nstatement. Other current items are:\n\n(i) the institutional record including program goals and\naccomplishments, academic achievements, vocational education,\ntraining or work assignments, therapy and interpersonal relationships\nwith staff and inmates;\n\n(ii) performance, if any, as a participant in a temporary release\nprogram;\n\n(iii) release plans including community resources, employment,\neducation and training and support services available to the inmate;\n\n(iv) any deportation order issued by the federal government against\nthe inmate while in the custody of the department of correctional\nservices and any recommendation regarding deportation made by the\ncommissioner of the department of correctional services pursuant to\nsection one hundred forty-seven of the correction law;\n\n(v) any statement made to the board by the crime victim or the\nvictim's representative, where the crime victim is deceased or is\nmentally or physically incapacitated; and\n\n(vi) the length of the determinate sentence to which the inmate would\nbe subject had he or she received a sentence pursuant to section\n70.70 or section 70.71 of the penal law for a felony defined in\narticle two twenty or article two hundred twenty-one of the penal\nlaw.\n\nA statement by the victim or the victim's representatives is also\npermitted.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nWhen it comes to making the critical determination whether to set\nsomeone free on parole, the board needs all the evidence it can\nmuster. This should include information from those with the most\nintimate knowledge of what the inmate is capable of. Police agencies\nknow this better than anyone else. Consider some of the recent\ndeterminations by the board: Recently, the Parole Board voted 2-1 to\ngrant parole to cop killer Shuaib Raheem. Raheem was involved in a\nbotched armed robbery in Williamsburg, NY in 1973, which resulted in\nthe death of Patrolman Stephen Gilroy and injured Patrolman Frank\nCarpentier.\nAlso recently, after pressure from some Senators and police\norganizations, cop killer John MacKenzie, who opened fire during a\nburglary in West Hempstead in 1975 and killed Nassau County Police\nOfficer Matthew Giglio, was denied parole. Another convicted\ncop-killer Anthony Blanks was scheduled for a parole hearing at\nShawangunk State Prison in Wallkill, NY. Blanks is a cold-blooded\ncop-killer and a dangerous criminal. He killed Patrolman Arthur\nDematte in 1976 in Larchmont, using the policeman's own revolver, and\nthen fled in his police cruiser. His hearing has now been postponed.\nThat homicide left Patrolman Dematte's wife without a husband, his\nfour young children without a father, and his fellow officers without\na friend and partner. Each time Anthony Blanks is eligible for\nparole, the family is once again victimized and the Police Department\nrelives this tragedy.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.8260 of 2010:  Referred to Rules\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
