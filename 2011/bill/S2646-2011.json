  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2646\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public authorities law, in relation to providing electronic\ntoll collection discounts for certain fuel efficient vehicles\n\nPURPOSE:\nThe bill provides owners of vehicles with a\nhigh mile per\ngallon fuel efficiency a ten percent \"Green EZ-Pass discount\" on\ntolls in New York.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThe bill amends the public\nauthorities law by\nadding a new section 388 that provides persons that have an\nelectronic toll collection system account with the New York State\nThruway Authority a ten percent discount on tolls incurred on New\nYork State toll roads, if they use a motor vehicle which has a\nhighway mile per gallon fuel efficiency of thirty-five miles per\ngallon or higher when incurring such tolls.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nTransportation remains one of the\ngreatest sources of\ncarbon dioxide emissions in our society. The promotion of vehicles\nwith high fuel efficiencies is desirable for environmental, public\nhealth, economic, and energy goals. Incentives should be greater for\nthose vehicles that have high fuel efficiencies. Persons that utilize\nthe toll roads of New York should be given incentives to drive\nvehicles with high fuel efficiencies. This bill provides encouragement\nfor the greater use of such vehicles by the public as they travel on\nNew York's tolled roads.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.4363 of 2007/08; Passed Senate in 2008\nS.857  of 2009/10; Referred to Transportation\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nMinimal.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect 180 days after it becomes a\nlaw, with provisions.\n\n",
