ORTIZ -- read once and referred to the Committee\n         on Economic Development, Job Creation, Commerce and Industry\n\n       AN ACT to amend the general  business  law,  in  relation  to  educating\n         foreign  women  entering this country as prospective spouses about the\n         history of the men they may be marrying and their rights as  residents\n         of the United States if they become victims of domestic violence\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as\n    2  the \"International Marriage Brokers Act\".\n    3    S 2. Legislative findings. In 1999, the Immigration and Naturalization\n    4  Service  commissioned  a  study  that  found more than 200 international\n    5  marriage brokers operating around the globe, arranging between 4,000 and\n    6  6,000 marriages between American  men  and  foreign  women  every  year.\n    7  Today, the number of international marriage brokers is nearly 500 world-\n    8  wide  and,  based  on  the  1999 statistics, 20,000 to 30,000 women have\n    9  entered the United States using an international marriage broker in  the\n   10  past  five  years.  In  1993, the Commonwealth Fund estimated that seven\n   11  percent of American women who are married or  living  with  someone  are\n   12  physically  abused in a year's time, and that the incidence is higher in\n   13  mail-order marriages.  The purpose of this act is to  regulate  interna-\n   14  tional  marriage  brokers and to inform prospective wives of the history\n   15  of the men they may be marrying and their rights  as  residents  of  the\n   16  United States if they become victims of domestic violence.\n   17    S 3. The general business law is amended by adding a new article 28-CC\n   18  to read as follows:\n   19                                ARTICLE 28-CC\n   20                     INTERNATIONAL MARRIAGE BROKERS ACT\n   21  SECTION 470.
