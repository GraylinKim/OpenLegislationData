  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2324\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act to amend the environmental conservation law, in relation to\nprohibiting the taking of northern or lined seahorses for commercial\npurposes\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nTo prohibit the taking of northern or lined seahorse (Hippocampus erec-\ntus) for commercial purposes.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nThis bill amends environmental conservation law by adding a new section\n13-0310.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nAn unregulated harvest and pet trade currently exists in seahorses\n(Hippocampus erectus). The northern seahorse is traded for use as aquar-\nium fishes, ornamental displays, curios and traditional Chinese medi-\ncine.\n\nLong Island's south shore estuaries provide habitat to the northern or\nlined seahorse (hippocampus erectus) during the warmer months of the\nyear. The Northern Seahorse can be common in the Great South and Morich-\nes Bay during the summer where it concentrates in vegetated areas like\neelgrass beds, but is apparently absent or very rare in the winter. It\nalso appears to be absent in other estuaries surrounding Long Island. It\nis thought that this species undergoes seasonal movements in which moves\ninto shallow coastal waters as they warm and then migrates off-shore\nduring the winter months.\n\nSeahorse behavior is characterized by monogamous pairing and fidelity to\nnarrow home ranges amongst all species studied. Being slow-moving or\nattached to eelgrass with their prehensile tails northern seahorses can\nbe easily captured by sweeping through eelgrass beds with seine nets.\n\nSeahorses are very difficult to keep alive in captivity. Little is known\nabout their overall abundance or population trends so it is unclear\nwhether they can sustain the level of harvest to which they are current-\nly being subjected. Any harvesting should only be for scientific or\neducational purposes.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n2009-10: S.870/A.2581\n2008:    S.7724-A/A.10702A.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nNo fiscal implications.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall have\nbecome a law.\n\n",
