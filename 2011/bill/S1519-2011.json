  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1519\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the executive law and the general business law,\nin relation to prohibiting discrimination in\nemployment decisions\nbased on consumer credit reports\n\nPURPOSE:\nThe purpose of this bill is to prohibit or severely limit the\nability of an employer to use a consumer credit report in its\ndecision making process to hire, terminate, promote or discipline an\nemployee or possible employee.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1: Amends Executive Law section 296 to prohibit or limit the\nability of an employer to use consumer credit reports or information\nincluded in such reports for decisions related to hiring,\nterminating, promoting or disciplining employees or potential\nemployees. An employer may use such information if the position\ndirectly relates to or has access to money or confidential personal\ninformation, or is a position in court administration or with a law\nenforcement agency. If an employer requests a consumer report for\nsuch sensitive positions that have access to money or confidential\ninformation, the employee or possible employee must sign an\nauthorization of consent form authorizing such use. Violation of this\nlaw shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice punishable under the\nExecutive Law.\n\nSection 2 and 3: Amends General Business Law section 380-b and 380-c\nto expand the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act to include\nprovisions similar to the ones provided above in bill section 1 with\nregard to the prohibition or limited use consumer credit reports.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe purpose of this bill is to limit\nan employer's\naccess to certain consumer credit reports and information in\nconnection with employment, so that those persons whose credit has\nbeen negatively affected by the current economic climate may be\neligible for jobs. This change to the law will exclude those jobs\nthat involve access to funds or negotiable instruments or directly\ninvolves financial oversight or responsibility.\n\nWith the current bad economic climate, many qualified persons, who\nthrough no fault of their own, have low credit scores because they\nhave not been able to find work for months or years at a time.\nFurther, these individuals are needlessly being disqualified for jobs\nthat they desperately need and which they are clearly qualified for.\nHowever, the consumer credit reports put an undeserved questionable\nmark on individuals who otherwise would be qualified for employment.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nNone.\n\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n180th day after it shall have become law.\n\n",
