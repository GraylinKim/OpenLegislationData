Six members shall\n   51  constitute a quorum, and except as otherwise provided in  this  section,\n   52  affirmative decisions of the commission shall require the concurrence of\n   53  seven members.\n   54    (e)  The members of the commission shall serve without salary or other\n   55  compensation, but shall be entitled  to  receive  actual  and  necessary\n\n       A. 3267                             9\n\n    1  expenses  incurred  in  the  discharge  of their duties pursuant to this\n    2  section.\n    3    (f)  The  commission  shall review criminal or juvenile cases in which\n    4  the defendant or respondent was sentenced but  subsequently  exonerated.\n    5  The  purpose  of  such  review is to consider whether experience in such\n    6  cases provides useful information  about  possible  reforms  that  could\n    7  enhance  safeguards,  make  improvements in the way that law enforcement\n    8  agencies and the criminal justice system function, and  protect  against\n    9  future  convictions  of  innocent  persons.  Such  possible  reforms may\n   10  include but are not limited to the areas of:\n   11    (1) investigative techniques that led to the  arrest,  identification,\n   12  and conviction of the innocent persons;\n   13    (2)  issues  relating  to  false  confessions,  including  whether the\n   14  recording of interrogations should be mandated;\n   15    (3) trial processes  and  procedures  that  may  have  contributed  to\n   16  convictions of innocent persons;\n   17    (4)  any  conduct of prosecutors, defense counsels, or courts that may\n   18  have contributed to convictions of innocent persons;\n   19    (5) issues relating to the provision of counsel  to  indigent  defend-\n   20  ants, including whether counsel are adequately trained, compensated, and\n   21  provided with appropriate resources for investigations; and\n   22    (6) failures in the appellate or post-conviction process that resulted\n   23  in  wrongful convictions not being discovered or corrected at an earlier\n   24  time.\n   25    (g) The commissioner of criminal justice services shall identify cases\n   26  in which convictions were set aside and  it  appears  reasonably  likely\n   27  that  the  person  convicted  was innocent of the crimes charged, and it\n   28  shall submit summaries of such cases to the commission. The commissioner\n   29  of criminal justice services shall seek to  submit  at  least  all  such\n   30  cases  in  which  exoneration  resulted  from DNA evidence, and all such\n   31  cases in which there was an exoneration within five years prior  to  the\n   32  effective  date  of this act. The commission of exoneration review shall\n   33  conduct an initial review of each case submitted by the commissioner  of\n   34  criminal  justice  services,  and  may  also  choose  to conduct initial\n   35  reviews of other cases. As to each case,  the  commission  shall  decide\n   36  whether such case warrants detailed review in that (1) it appears highly\n   37  likely  that  the  person  convicted was actually innocent of the crimes\n   38  charged, and (2) there appear to  be  features  of  the  case  that  may\n   39  provide useful information without possible reforms.\n   40    (h)  When  the  commission  for exoneration review decides that a case\n   41  warrants detailed review, the commissioner of criminal justice  services\n   42  shall  compile  records and other information relating to that case, and\n   43  may  solicit  comments  or  analyses  by  experts  in  relevant  fields.\n   44  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commissioner of criminal\n   45  justice  services  may request and shall receive from any court, depart-\n   46  ment, division, board, bureau, commission or other agency of  the  state\n   47  or  political subdivision thereof, or any public authority, such assist-\n   48  ance, records and data as will enable it effectively to  carry  out  its\n   49  duties.  The commissioner of criminal justice services shall submit such\n   50  records, information, comments, and analyses to the commission of  exon-\n   51  eration  review.  Confidential  and  sensitive material, such as certain\n   52  information relating to victims  and  confidential  informants,  may  be\n   53  redacted  as  appropriate.  The  commission  for  exoneration review may\n   54  conduct its detailed review on the basis of the materials submitted,  or\n   55  it  may request the commissioner of criminal justice services to compile\n   56  and submit further specified kinds of information about the case.\n\n       A. 3267                            10\n\n    1    (i) The commission for exoneration  review  shall  make  available  an\n    2  annual  report detailing, at a minimum, the number of cases submitted by\n    3  the commissioner of criminal  justice  services,  the  number  of  cases\n    4  chosen   for  detailed  review,  and  the  number  of  detailed  reviews\n    5  completed. The report shall include any findings of fact and recommenda-\n    6  tions  for reform that may have been adopted by the commission since its\n    7  last report. Recommendations that are not adopted by the commission  but\n    8  obtain the concurrence of at least four members shall be included in the\n    9  annual  report as proposals for consideration. In addition to the annual\n   10  report, the commission may decide  to  issue  other  reports  containing\n   11  findings  of fact and/or recommendations for reform.  All reports issued\n   12  by the commission shall be made available to the public and delivered to\n   13  the governor, the chief judge of the court  of  appeals,  the  temporary\n   14  president of the senate, and the speaker of the assembly.\n   15    S 15.
