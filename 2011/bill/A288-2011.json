PAULIN,  GALEF,  GUNTHER, MAYERSOHN, CASTRO,\n         JAFFEE, REILLY, SCARBOROUGH, TOBACCO -- Multi-Sponsored by -- M. of A.\n         McENENY, WEISENBERG -- read once and  referred  to  the  Committee  on\n         Health\n\n       AN  ACT  to  amend the public health law, in relation to prohibiting the\n         sale of flavored tobacco products\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section  1.  Legislative  findings.  The  legislature hereby finds and\n    2  declares that  there  has  been  a  proliferation  of  flavored  tobacco\n    3  products  in  recent years. Many of these products have fruit, chocolate\n    4  or other flavors that are particularly attractive to children. According\n    5  to public health experts, children are more likely  to  choose  flavored\n    6  tobacco  products  when they start using tobacco, and thus the existence\n    7  of these products increases the incidence of tobacco use among children.\n    8  Moreover, the earlier that an individual begins using tobacco, the  more\n    9  likely  he  or  she  will  become  addicted to tobacco products and will\n   10  continue to use them throughout  his  or  her  lifetime.  As  a  result,\n   11  flavored  tobacco  products  result  in increased tobacco use, increased\n   12  addiction, a greater incidence of tobacco-related  illnesses,  increased\n   13  health  care costs, and more tobacco-related deaths. In 2009, the United\n   14  States Congress enacted legislation prohibiting  the  sale  of  flavored\n   15  cigarettes,  but  such  action does not apply to other tobacco products.\n   16  The legislature, therefore, finds and  declares  that  flavored  tobacco\n   17  products,  like  flavored  cigarettes,  present  a significant threat to\n   18  public health, and that the sale of flavored tobacco  products  must  be\n   19  prohibited.\n   20    S  2. Article 13-F of the public health law is amended by adding a new\n   21  section 1399-aaa to read as follows:\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD00758-01-1\n\n       A. 288                              2\n\n    1    S 1399-AAA. SALE OF FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS PROHIBITED. 1. NO PERSON\n    2  SHALL SELL OR OFFER FOR SALE IN  THIS  STATE  ANY  TOBACCO  PRODUCT,  AS\n    3  DEFINED  IN  SUBDIVISION  TWO OF SECTION FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY OF THE TAX\n    4  LAW, OR ANY COMPONENT PART THEREOF, INCLUDING BUT NOT  LIMITED  TO,  THE\n    5  TOBACCO,  PAPER,  ROLL OR FILTER, WHICH CONTAINS A NATURAL OR ARTIFICIAL\n    6  CONSTITUENT OR ADDITIVE THAT CAUSES SUCH TOBACCO PRODUCT OR ITS SMOKE TO\n    7  HAVE A CHARACTERIZING FLAVOR.\n    8    2. FOR THE  PURPOSES  OF  THIS  SECTION,  THE  PHRASE  \"CHARACTERIZING\n    9  FLAVOR\"  SHALL  MEAN A DISTINGUISHABLE TASTE OR AROMA, INCLUDING BUT NOT\n   10  LIMITED TO ANY FRUIT, CHOCOLATE, VANILLA, HONEY, CANDY, COCOA,  DESSERT,\n   11  ALCOHOLIC  BEVERAGE,  HERB  OR  SPICE  FLAVORING,  BUT SHALL NOT INCLUDE\n   12  TOBACCO, MENTHOL, MINT, OR WINTERGREEN. IN  NO  EVENT  SHALL  A  TOBACCO\n   13  PRODUCT  OR ANY COMPONENT PART THEREOF, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE\n   14  TOBACCO, PAPER, ROLL OR FILTER BE CONSTRUED  TO  HAVE  A  CHARACTERIZING\n   15  FLAVOR  BASED  SOLELY  ON  THE  USE  OF  ADDITIVES OR FLAVORINGS, OR THE\n   16  PROVISION OF AN INGREDIENT LIST MADE AVAILABLE BY ANY MEANS.\n   17    3. ANY PERSON OTHER THAN A MANUFACTURER WHO VIOLATES THE PROVISIONS OF\n   18  THIS SECTION SHALL BE SUBJECT TO A FINE OF NOT  MORE  THAN  ONE  HUNDRED\n   19  DOLLARS  FOR  EACH INDIVIDUAL PACKAGE OF TOBACCO PRODUCT SOLD OR OFFERED\n   20  FOR SALE. A MANUFACTURER MAY BE SUBJECT TO A CIVIL PENALTY NOT TO EXCEED\n   21  FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH BRAND OR STYLE  OF  THAT  MANUFACTURER'S\n   22  TOBACCO  PRODUCTS THAT IS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN SOLD OR OFFERED FOR SALE IN\n   23  VIOLATION OF THIS SECTION ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION  DURING  ANY  THIRTY\n   24  DAY  PERIOD.  VIOLATIONS  OF  THIS SECTION SHALL BE ENFORCED PURSUANT TO\n   25  SECTION THIRTEEN HUNDRED NINETY-NINE-FF OF THIS ARTICLE, EXCEPT THAT ANY\n   26  PERSON MAY SUBMIT A COMPLAINT TO AN ENFORCEMENT OFFICER THAT A VIOLATION\n   27  OF THIS SECTION HAS OCCURRED.\n   28    S 3. This act shall take effect on the one hundred fiftieth day  after\n   29  it shall have become a law.\n",
