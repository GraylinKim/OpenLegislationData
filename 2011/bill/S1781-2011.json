  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1781\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the criminal procedure law, in relation to requiring victims be\ninformed of right to make victim impact statement to division of parole\nand to appear at parole hearing\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nCrime victims would be automatically notified of upcoming parole\nhearings of their assailants, allows them to testify at those\nhearings, and obligates district attorneys to inform crime victims of\ntheir right to file a victim impact statement. Currently, most crime\nvictims are unaware of their right to file written crime victim\nimpact statements or be informed of upcoming parole hearings of their\nattackers.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSubdivision 1 of section 440.50 of the criminal\nprocedure law, as amended by chapter 186 of the laws of 2005, is\namended by requiring district attorneys to inform crime victims of\ntheir right to submit a written victim impact statement to the state\ndivision of parole and of the right to be informed of their\nassailant's parole hearing, and allows crime victims to appear at the\nparole board hearing to make a statement before the parole board.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nWhile a victim impact statement already exists, few crime victims are\naware of their right to submit this statement, nor are most informed\nof their right to be notified when their assailant is up for parole.\nLess than 5% of crime victims file written victim impact statements,\nsuggesting that most are unaware of the right to do so.\n\nThe effect that a crime can have on its victim{s) can be devastating,\nbut the criminal justice system does not encourage crime victims to\nvoice the impact an offense has had on them mentally, physically,\nemotionally or financially. The district attorney's office, which is\nin close communication with the victims, rarely informs them of their\nright to file victim impact statements. The victim impact statement,\nif available, is put in the criminal's permanent file with the\nDivision of Parole, and is reviewed by the parole board examining an\ninmate's application for early release.\n\nWhen parole boards review an inmate's application for release,\ninsufficient consideration is given to the effect the criminal's\naction has had on the victim{s). Parole board members need to be\nreminded of the reason the inmate is in prison and the nature of the\ncrime committed. Increasing the response rate for victim impact\nstatements and allowing crime victims the opportunity to speak at\nparole board hearings will present to parole boards a reminder of the\nimpact the criminals' actions have had on their victims.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nThis bill was previously introduced.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\n\nMinimal costs to inform victims by mail of their assailant's parole\nhearing.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately upon enactment.\n\n",
