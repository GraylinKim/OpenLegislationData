  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1279\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the alcoholic beverage control law, in\nrelation to prohibiting the\ntransfer of liquor licenses to new owners\n\nPURPOSE:\nThe purpose of this bill is to stop the automatic transfer of a liquor\nlicense to a new owner of a bar or club that is sold to them.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection One of the bill amends Section 64 of the alcoholic beverage\ncontrol law by adding subdivision 4-a. Subdivision 4-a would require\nthat no licensee shall transfer any interest in a license to any new\nowner of such licensee's establishment, bar or club. Such license\nshall terminate at the time ownership of the property is transferred\nto the new owner.\n\nA new owner will be granted a 45 day temporary license in which time\nsuch person shall apply for a permanent license.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nAn owner of an establishment, bar or club goes through a lengthy\napplication process before the State Liquor Authority (SLA) will\ngrant a liquor license. The state Liquor Authority looks for\ncommunity input and reviews the impact such an establishment will\nhave on those who live in the immediate area. currently, if an owner\nsells an establishment to a new owner, the liquor license is also\nautomatically transferred to the new owner. New ownership may\ndramatically change the impact a bar or club has on a community, and\nyet, no thorough review of the community impact the new bar or club\nwill be reviewed by the State Liquor Authority.\n\nThis bill will insure that the new owners of a bar or club go through\nthe State Liquor Authority's review process. Under this bill, a\nliquor license will not be transferred along with the sale of the\nestablishment. Rather, a temporary 45 day license will be granted to\nthe new owners. A 45 day temporary license will allow for continuous\noperation of an establishment after a sale, and allows time for the\nnew ownership to apply for a new license. Application for a new\nlicense will allow the State Liquor Authority to review any changes\nthe new ownership may have on a community, and will allow a community\nto speak out on concerns it may have regarding the granting of a new\nlicense.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2001-02: S.2052 Died in Senate Investigations, Taxation and\nGovernment Operations Committee.\n2003-04: S.3244 Died in Commerce, Economic Development and Small\n\nBusiness Committee\n2005-06: S.2584 Died in Commerce, Economic\nDevelopment and Small Business Committee\n2007:    S.2948 (Duane), Died in Commerce, Economic\nDevelopment, and Small Business\n2008:    S.2948 (Duane), Died in Commerce, Economic Development,\nand Small Business\n2009:    S.1439 (Duane), Died in Commerce, Economic Development, and\nSmall Business; A.6176 (Kavanagh), Died in Economic Development\n2010:    S.1439 (Duane), Died in Commerce, Economic Development,\nand Small Business; A.6176 (Kavanagh), Died in Economic Development\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nMinimal.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nMinimal\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect one hundred twentieth days after it shall\nhave become a law.\n\n",
