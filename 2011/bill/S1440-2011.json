SQUADRON -- read twice and ordered printed, and when\n         printed to be committed to the Committee on Codes\n\n       AN ACT to amend the penal law and the general business law, in  relation\n         to banning the possession, sale or manufacture of assault weapons; and\n         to  repeal  subdivision 22 of section 265.00 of the penal law relating\n         thereto\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section  1.  The  New York state legislature finds that semi-automatic\n    2  assault weapons are military-style guns  designed  to  allow  rapid  and\n    3  accurate spray firing for the quick and efficient killing of humans. The\n    4  shooter  can  simply point - as opposed to carefully aim - the weapon to\n    5  quickly spray a wide area with a hail of bullets. Gun manufacturers have\n    6  for many years made,  marketed  and  sold  to  civilians  semi-automatic\n    7  versions of military assault weapons designed with features specifically\n    8  intended  to  increase lethality for military applications. As a result,\n    9  approximately 2,000,000 assault weapons are currently in circulation  in\n   10  the  United  States. These weapons have been the weapon of choice in the\n   11  most notorious mass  shootings  of  innocent  civilians  in  the  United\n   12  States,  including  the  1999 massacre at Columbine High School (TEC-DC9\n   13  assault pistol and Hi-Point Carbine) and the 2002 Washington,  D.C.-area\n   14  sniper shootings (Bushmaster XM15 assault rifle). According to FBI data,\n   15  between 1998 and 2001, one in five law enforcement officers slain in the\n   16  line  of  duty was killed with an assault weapon. In 2003, New York lost\n   17  two of its finest when undercover officers in the elite Firearms  Inves-\n   18  tigation  Unit  of the NYPD Organized Crime Control Bureau were brutally\n   19  murdered while attempting to purchase an  illegal  TEC-9  semi-automatic\n   20  assault weapon. The availability of military-style assault weapons poses\n   21  a serious threat to the public health and safety. Most citizens, includ-\n   22  ing  most  gun owners, believe that assault weapons should not be avail-\n   23  able for civilian use.\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD02260-01-1\n\n       S. 1440                             2\n\n    1    S 2.
