SCHIMMINGER, SWEENEY, MORELLE, DESTITO, TOWNS,\n         SCHROEDER, LUPARDO, HOYT -- Multi-Sponsored by --  M.  of  A.  COLTON,\n         MAGNARELLI,  McENENY, MILLMAN -- read once and referred to the Commit-\n         tee on Small Business\n\n       AN ACT to amend the public authorities law, in relation  to  recodifica-\n         tion  of the small business innovation research program and the awards\n         made thereunder within the New  York  state  foundation  for  science,\n         technology  and  innovation;  and to repeal section 3102-c of such law\n         relating to the small business innovation research program\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The state small business innovation\n    2  research (SBIR) program, which began in 1984, was  designed  to  provide\n    3  assistance  to  New York's newer high technology companies, helping them\n    4  compete for a greater share of the federal research contracts under  the\n    5  federal  SBIR program. The state program was highly successful, increas-\n    6  ing the amount of federal SBIR dollars coming into the state from  under\n    7  five million dollars annually to over thirty million dollars by 1991. As\n    8  importantly,  state  assistance under this program greatly increased the\n    9  ability of federal SBIR Phase I award winners to compete for much larger\n   10  SBIR Phase II awards. Although the state SBIR statute remains in effect,\n   11  the state stopped funding the program after its initial success, in part\n   12  because of disagreement over how to allocate  limited  funds  among  the\n   13  rapidly  increasing  number of federal SBIR award winners. Consequently,\n   14  the number of state winners dramatically decreased.  This act recodifies\n   15  the small business innovation research program within the public author-\n   16  ities law under the auspices of the foundation for  science,  technology\n   17  and  innovation,  and  clarifies how funds will be allocated so that the\n   18  program can begin anew to assist  small  high  technology  companies  to\n   19  compete  for  federal  SBIR funds, which will help them grow and provide\n   20  new jobs for New York citizens.\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD06348-01-1\n\n       A. 3410                             2\n\n    1    S 2. The public authorities law is amended by  adding  a  new  section\n    2  3154-a to read as follows:\n    3    S  3154-A.  SMALL  BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH PROGRAM. 1.
