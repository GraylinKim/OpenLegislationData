THIS ARTICLE SHALL BE KNOWN AND MAY BE CITED AS\n   15  THE \"NEW YORK STATE HEAD INJURY AWARENESS AND PREVENTION ACT\".\n   16    S 3051. LEGISLATIVE INTENT.  1. IT IS AND HAS BEEN  THE  LONG-STANDING\n   17  POLICY  OF  THE STATE OF NEW YORK THAT THE WELL-BEING OF OUR CHILDREN IS\n   18  PARAMOUNT. THE STATE ALSO HAS A PROUD HISTORY OF PROMOTING THE  DEVELOP-\n   19  MENT  OF  HEALTHY  MINDS  AND  BODIES  IN OUR CHILDREN BY INVOLVEMENT IN\n   20  SPORTS, WHICH STATE POLICY HAS SUPPORTED AT ALL LEVELS OF OUR  EDUCATION\n   21  AND  HIGHER  EDUCATION SYSTEMS.   REPORTED MILD TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES\n   22  (TBIS), COMMONLY KNOWN AS CONCUSSIONS, OCCUR AT  ALL  LEVELS  OF  SPORTS\n   23  PLAY.  THE  NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH REPORTS THAT BETWEEN THE\n   24  YEARS TWO THOUSAND SIX AND TWO THOUSAND  EIGHT  MORE  THAN  TWENTY-THREE\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD06753-01-1\n\n       S. 861                              2\n\n    1  THOUSAND  SCHOOL  AGED  YOUTH  VISITED  THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OR WERE\n    2  HOSPITALIZED FOR CONCUSSIONS ANNUALLY WITH THE  COST  OF  THEIR  MEDICAL\n    3  CARE  APPROACHING  EIGHTY  MILLION DOLLARS.

THE LEGISLATURE FURTHER FINDS THAT  EARLY  INTERVENTION,  RESPONSE,\n    8  AND  THE PROPER EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF CONCUSSIONS WILL LESSEN THE\n    9  EFFECTS OF THIS POTENTIALLY LIFE THREATENING INJURY.  IT IS ESSENTIAL TO\n   10  EDUCATE PARENTS AND GUARDIANS, STUDENTS, COACHES AND SCHOOL PERSONNEL ON\n   11  THE EARLY AND ACCURATE RECOGNITION OF THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF  CONCUS-\n   12  SIONS  AND  THE POTENTIAL HARMFUL EFFECTS OF HEAD INJURIES NOT JUST ON A\n   13  CHILD'S PHYSICAL WELL-BEING BUT ON HIS OR HER  ACADEMIC  PERFORMANCE  AS\n   14  WELL.\n   15    3.
