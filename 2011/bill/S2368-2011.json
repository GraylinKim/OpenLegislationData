  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2368\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to increasing the severity of rape in\nthe second degree, criminal sexual act in the second degree, sexual\nabuse in the second degree and course of sexual conduct against a child\nin the second degree\n\nPURPOSE:\nThe purpose of the legislation is to increase by one degree\nthe severity of rape, criminal sexual act, sexual abuse and course of\nsexual conduct against a child in the second degrees.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1. The closing paragraph of section 130.30 of the penal law is\namended to make rape in the second degree a class C felony.\nSection 2. The closing paragraph of section 130.45 of the penal law is\namended to make criminal sexual act in the second degree a class C\nfelony.\nSection 3. The closing paragraph of section 130.60 of the penal law is\namended to make sexual abuse in the second degree a class E felony.\nSection 4. The closing paragraph of section 130.80 of the penal law is\namended to make course of sexual conduct against a child in the\nsecond degree a class C felony.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nFelony sexual assaults are serious crimes, but the\ncurrent sentencing structure does not reflect the severity of the\ncrimes. Currently, first-time sex offenders convicted of a class D\nfelony will receive only two years; while those convicted two or more\ntimes will receive only five years imprisonment. With this light\nsentencing, many sex offenders could be released when their victims\nare still vulnerable minors. The current sentencing structure is far\ntoo lenient on perverse people who prey on our most vulnerable\npopulation. The penalties need to be increased to reflect the\nseverity of the crimes; to keep these predators away from our\nchildren; and to keep those in our most vulnerable population safe.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.7367 of 2010\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the first of November\nnext succeeding the date on which it shall have become a law.\n\n",
