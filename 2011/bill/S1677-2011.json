The act will create budget transparency as it relates to\nimproper payments, and hold government agencies accountable for\nimproper payments.\n\nSpecifically, IPRRA will (1) require state agencies to annually\nidentify programs that are at risk of a significant amount of\nimproper payments; (2) require state agencies to annually estimate\nthe amount of improper payments; and; and (3) require state agencies\nto report on what actions and protocols are being implemented to\nreduce the amount of such improper payments.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nSection 1: Entitles the bill the \"Improper Payment Reporting &\nReduction Act\"\n\nSection 2: Adds a new article 4-B in the Executive Law so that:\n\n- state agencies or programs that spend more than $20 million a year\nand that potentially or actually lose over $5 million dollars a year\nto improper payments must annually (1) identify programs that are at\nrisk of a significant amount of improper payments, (2) estimate the\namount of improper payments, and (3) report on what actions and\nprotocols are being implemented to reduce the amount of such improper\npayments. The first reports will be due in the annual budget\nsubmissions for agencies for fiscal years 2011-2012.\n\n- creates an Improper Payment Estimate Guidance Group to consult with\nthe state comptroller and prescribe guidance to agencies on how they\nwill identify, estimate and report on improper payments. The group\nshall be chaired by the director of the division of the budget and\nshall additionally include the state inspector general, the medicaid\ninspector general, the metropolitan transportation authority\ninspector general, and the welfare inspector general. Agencies are\nrequired to cooperate with the improper payment guidance group as\nneeded for the development of the guidance.\n\n- requires the Improper Payment Estimate Guidance Group to meet within\nsix months after passage of this legislation, and requires the group\nto additionally meet at any time at the suggestion of either the\ndirector of division of the budget or the state comptroller; provided\nthat the group must\nmeet no fewer than once every four years to review the improper\npayment guidance.\n\nSection 3: Sets the effective date immediately.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\nThe same as S.8122 of 2010, Passed the Senate\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis bill would be effective immediately.\n\n",
