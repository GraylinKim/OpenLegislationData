PERALTA -- read twice and ordered printed, and when\n         printed to be committed to the Committee on Codes\n\n       AN ACT to amend the general business law and the penal law, in  relation\n         to preventing the sale of firearms, rifles, and shotguns to criminals\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Legislative findings and declaration. The legislature here-\n    2  by finds and declares as follows:\n    3    1. Firearms, rifles and shotguns are used to kill nearly 30,000  indi-\n    4  viduals  in the United States every year, including 1,000 individuals in\n    5  New York state alone. Additionally, there are 100,000 non-fatal injuries\n    6  across the country. The federal  government  has  largely  ignored  this\n    7  public  health  crisis and has left it up to state and local governments\n    8  to protect its citizens. Firearm violence also costs millions of dollars\n    9  and causes  incalculable  emotional  damage,  devastating  families  and\n   10  communities  throughout  the country.   Therefore, the state of New York\n   11  has a strong interest in reducing violence and crimes that  involve  the\n   12  use  of  firearms  and the illegal trafficking of firearms. Illegal guns\n   13  obtained throughout the state end up in the hands  of  criminals,  youth\n   14  and violent individuals who use them to threaten, maim and kill.\n   15    2. There is a thriving underground market for illegal firearms, large-\n   16  ly  driven by demand from drug gangs and other criminals. A highly effi-\n   17  cient and continuous business practice  exists  in  which  firearms  are\n   18  moved  from  legal manufacture and sale to prohibited purchasers, making\n   19  them illegal firearms. In 2001, approximately 12,000  illegal  firearms,\n   20  rifles  and  shotguns were seized in New York state.  From November 2000\n   21  to April 2002, 2700 crime guns were entered into  the  state  crime  gun\n   22  database.  In 2008, according to a review by the federal bureau of alco-\n   23  hol,  tobacco, firearms, and explosives (ATF) of trace data compiled for\n   24  several regions in the  state,  including  Albany,  Buffalo,  Rochester,\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD00321-01-1\n\n       S. 965                              2\n\n    1  Syracuse,  Long  Island  and  New  York  City  that calendar year, 9,558\n    2  firearms were submitted to be traced, 2,659 of  which  were  long  guns.\n    3  Outside  New  York  City, long guns are sold without a permit. Forty-six\n    4  percent  of  the  firearms recovered in 2008 were found outside New York\n    5  City.  A significant portion of guns involved in crimes  upstate  origi-\n    6  nate  within the state. In fact, youth data reveals that in 2000, 40% of\n    7  the crime guns in Buffalo originated within a five-mile radius  of  that\n    8  city.\n    9    3. A substantial portion of illegal firearms are diverted to the ille-\n   10  gal  market  through  licensed gun dealers. Rogue gun dealers play a key\n   11  role in this market. These rogue dealers  funnel  guns  to  the  illegal\n   12  market through a variety of channels. One of the most common means is to\n   13  allow \"straw purchases\". A straw purchase occurs when a person purchases\n   14  a  gun  on  behalf of a prohibited person. The ATF conducted an investi-\n   15  gation of gun trafficking from July 1996 to December 1998 and found that\n   16  almost 26,000 trafficked firearms were associated with investigations in\n   17  which there was a straw purchaser. Almost 50% of all trafficking  inves-\n   18  tigations  involved  straw  purchasers,  with  an average of 37 firearms\n   19  trafficked per investigation.  Another issue, according to a 2008 report\n   20  by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Inside Straw Purchasing:  How  Criminals\n   21  Get  Guns  Illegally,  is that many traffickers return to the same store\n   22  again and again once they have identified it as one in  which  they  can\n   23  make  straw  purchases easily.   Although most gun dealers operate their\n   24  businesses legally and responsibly, some gun dealers who are corrupt  or\n   25  maintain  shoddy  recordkeeping practices flood the streets with illegal\n   26  weapons as a result of their unrestricted access to  new  gun  inventory\n   27  and  the unwillingness of gun manufacturers to terminate their supply to\n   28  these rogue dealers. Current federal and state regulation has not curbed\n   29  the business practice of illegal gun dealers. According to a 2004  study\n   30  by  Americans  for Gun Safety, of the 120 worst gun dealers in the coun-\n   31  try, namely those dealers with an average of 500 crime  guns  traced  to\n   32  them, 96 were still in operation.\n   33    4.  Moreover,  this  problem is not limited to unlicensed sellers, and\n   34  clearly includes federal firearms  licensees  (FFLs).  Indeed,  although\n   35  FFLs were involved in under 10% of the trafficking investigations under-\n   36  taken  by  ATF, they were associated with the largest number of diverted\n   37  firearms--over 40,000 guns, which is nearly half of the total number  of\n   38  trafficked  firearms  documented  during  the  two-year  period of ATF's\n   39  investigation.  Additionally, a 2008 report by  Mayors  Against  Illegal\n   40  Guns  indicated  that  several  states  which allow state authorities to\n   41  supplement the federal ATF inspections with routine inspections  provide\n   42  law  enforcement with more opportunities to uncover dealers in violation\n   43  of the law. These inspections also help identify  dealers  who  exercise\n   44  lax  oversight  over their inventory and may lead to improved compliance\n   45  with federal, state and local laws.\n   46    5. Current New York state laws governing firearm  dealers  are  inade-\n   47  quate  to  prevent the diversion of firearms to the illegal marketplace.\n   48  Additional protections that are needed include, but are not limited  to,\n   49  better  gun dealer internal compliance procedures, programs to eliminate\n   50  straw purchases, increased liability insurance, improved security  meas-\n   51  ures,  reducing  youth access, mandatory training for gun dealer employ-\n   52  ees, and improved recordkeeping requirements. The additional protections\n   53  set forth in this act will greatly enhance the state's efforts to reduce\n   54  criminal activity in the state.\n   55    S 2.
