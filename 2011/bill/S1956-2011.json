  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1956\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the state finance law, in relation to the submission of\nlegislative budget bills\n\nSUMMARY:\nThis bill adds new section 28 to the state finance law to\nrequire, if either house of the Legislature has failed to adopt a\nbudget by the first day of the fiscal year to which such budget\napplies, that the leaders of each house shall submit to the chairmen\nand ranking minority members of their respective fiscal committees,\nthe minority leader of each house, the governor and the comptroller,\na report either recommending passage of the Governor's budget bills\nor specifically detailing any proposed amendments, additions,\nreductions or deletions.\nSuch report shall also identify any amendments to the state financial\nplan which would be required by the report's recommendations.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nFiscal year 1991-92 is the seventh consecutive fiscal\nyear for which the Legislature has failed to pass a budget on time.\nWhile the state constitution requires the Governor to submit his\ndetailed budget in a timely fashion, no requirement exists for the\nlegislative leaders to submit their own proposals. Details of the\nbudget formulation process, of the proposals and counter-proposals,\nhave been shrouded in secret negotiations among the Temporary\nPresident of the Senate, the Speaker of the Assembly and the\nGovernor. The result has been seven years of budget stalemates that\nhave cost local governments, school districts and, of course, state\ntaxpayers millions of dollars each year. This bill is designed to\nforce the legislative leaders to make public their specific proposals\nin response to the Governor's budget. The effect will be more\nproductive negotiations taking place within a context of informed\ndebate, ultimately resulting in timely passage of the budget and\ngreater accountability of our elected leaders.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATION:\nNone to the state.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
