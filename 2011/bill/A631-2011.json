WEINSTEIN,   ORTIZ,  CUSICK,  DINOWITZ,\n         PEOPLES-STOKES -- read once and referred to the Committee on Insurance\n\n       AN ACT to amend the insurance law, in relation to  requiring  all  motor\n         vehicle  insurers  to  file  annual  financial statements and detailed\n         claim data with the superintendent of insurance\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds and\n    2  declares that insurance companies issuing motor vehicle policies in this\n    3  state owe a duty to those they insure and to those who may in the future\n    4  be insured by them, to fully disclose in a public and transparent manner\n    5  all elements relating to their financial condition  and  solvency.  Such\n    6  obligation  is  essential  in maintaining the public's inherent right to\n    7  know the details and specifics of such  insurer's  expenses  and  claims\n    8  history on a global basis so, as consumers, they can make a reasoned and\n    9  rational selection of the insurer with which they intend to do business.\n   10  As  premiums  escalate,  it  is more incumbent on such insurers to honor\n   11  this obligation by making the public aware of the rationale they use  in\n   12  determining  the premiums they charge, and it is the sense of the legis-\n   13  lature that where the data used is available, it should be disclosed  in\n   14  an open and public manner.\n   15    S  2. The insurance law is amended by adding a new section 342 to read\n   16  as follows:\n   17    S 342. FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND DETAILED CLAIM DATA TO  BE  FILED  WITH\n   18  THE  DEPARTMENT.
