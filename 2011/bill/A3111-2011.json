CALHOUN, ZEBROWSKI, N. RIVERA, LAVINE -- Multi-\n         Sponsored by -- M. of A. BURLING, WEISENBERG -- read once and referred\n         to the Committee on Transportation\n\n       AN ACT to amend the vehicle and traffic law, in  relation  to  requiring\n         school  buses  to  have identification numbers printed on roof of such\n         vehicles\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section  1.  Legislative  findings  and intent. The legislature hereby\n    2  finds that it is necessary to provide  as  many  safety  precautions  as\n    3  possible  for  our  children.  With an influx of traffic on the roadways\n    4  that are used to transport our children to and from school,  it  may  be\n    5  difficult  to  identify  a  particular bus in the event of an emergency.\n    6  Having an identification number displayed on the roof would provide  for\n    7  more  efficient  identification  of  the  school  bus from the air. This\n    8  legislation gives law enforcement officials an additional tool in  their\n    9  arsenal to ensure the safety of our children.\n   10    S  2.  Section  1223-a  of  the vehicle and traffic law, as amended by\n   11  chapter 94 of the laws of 1998, is amended to read as follows:\n   12    S 1223-a. School buses; required identification. 1. All school  buses,\n   13  as  defined in section one hundred forty-two of this chapter, purchased,\n   14  leased or acquired on or after September first, nineteen  hundred  nine-\n   15  ty-seven  shall  have  the  area  code and telephone number of the owner\n   16  and/or operator printed  in three inch bold type on  the  rear  of  such\n   17  vehicle.    Provided,  however,  that  nothing contained herein shall be\n   18  deemed to prohibit the printing of such information as  herein  provided\n   19  on  school buses purchased, acquired or leased prior to September first,\n   20  nineteen hundred ninety-seven.\n   21    2. ALL SCHOOL BUSES, AS DEFINED IN SECTION ONE  HUNDRED  FORTY-TWO  OF\n   22  THIS  CHAPTER,  SHALL HAVE A SCHOOL BUS IDENTIFICATION NUMBER PRINTED ON\n   23  THE ROOF OF SUCH VEHICLE.\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD02849-01-1\n\n       A. 3111                             2\n\n    1    S 3. The commissioner of  motor  vehicles,  in  conjunction  with  the\n    2  commissioner  of  education,  shall promulgate rules and regulations for\n    3  the size, type, design and display of  such  school  bus  identification\n    4  numbers.\n    5    S  4.
