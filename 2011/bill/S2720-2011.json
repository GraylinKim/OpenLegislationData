  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2720\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the environmental conservation law, in relation to reducing the\nemission of pollutants from diesel fuel-powered motor vehicles owned by\nagencies of cities with populations over 45,000\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nThe bill will require cities with populations over 45,000 to\nincrementally reduce emissions in diesel powered motor vehicles\n(trucks, garbage and recycling trucks, buses, construction vehicles,\netc.) owned by city agencies.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nSection one of the bill adds a new section to environmental\nconservation law relating to the use of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel\nand best available technology by diesel fuel-powered motor vehicles\nin cities with populations over forty-five thousand.\n\nThe section requires each diesel fuel-powered motor vehicle owned or\noperated by a city agency be powered by ultra low sulfur diesel fuel.\nThe section establishes a schedule for cities to insure that all\ndiesel fuel-powered vehicles (having a gross vehicle weight of more\nthan 8,500 pounds) are either retrofitted with best available\ntechnology or equipped with an engine certified to EPA particulate\nmatter standards.\n\nThe section directs the Commissioner of DEC to determine, and publish\na list of, best available retrofit technologies to be used for each\ntype of diesel truck, issue a written determination that permits the\nuse of diesel fuel that has a sulfur content of no more than 30\nparts per million to fulfill the requirements of the legislation, and\nprovide waivers for localities for which the low sulfur fuel is not\nreadily available.\n\nIt requires a report to the legislature regarding, among other things,\nthe use of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel and the use of the best\navailable retrofit technology by city-owned trucks, buses, etc. In\nthe section there are listed occasions when the provisions will not\napply.\nThere is a severability clause.\n\nSection two is the enacting clause.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\n\nThis legislation adds a new section to Environmental Conservation Law.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nThis legislation is intended to reduce the emission of pollutants in,\nand the noise levels of, heavy-duty on- and off-road diesel-powered\ntrucks like garbage and recycling trucks, buses, and construction\nvehicles in New York State's urban areas.\n\nVehicle emissions pose serious health concerns for those who live and\nwork in New York cities. These pollutants may result in respiratory\nproblems, such as aggravated asthma and decreased lung function. In\naddition to particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides,\ndiesel exhaust contains a number of air toxins, including benzene,\nformaldehyde and dioxin. The negative health impacts stemming from\nthese emissions are especially detrimental to children and the\nelderly, the former of whom actually breathe fifty percent more air\nper pound of body weight than adults.\n\nWhat may be most alarming about diesel exhaust is the considerable\nevidence that it is a likely carcinogen. In the EPA's Health\nAssessment Document for Diesel Engine Exhaust, \"diesel exhaust was\nclassified as likely to be carcinogenic to humans by inhalation at\nenvironmental exposures...\" In addition, human epidemiological\nstudies demonstrate an association between exposure to the exhaust\nand increased lung cancer rates in occupational settings.\n\nThe connection between vehicle exhaust and asthma is also of great\nconsequence to New York's cities, which suffer from some of the\nhighest asthma rates in the country. Studies have concluded that\n\"routine exposure to dirty air during childhood actually harms lung\ndevelopment, leading to a permanently reduced ability to breathe\" and\nthat \"environmental pollutants... -- including combustion\nbyproducts... -- may increase the rate of low birth weight babies and\nbabies with smaller heads, both of which may be linked to lower IQ\nand poorer school performance.\"\n\nWe can have cleaner air and quieter, healthier neighborhoods and make\ngenuine progress toward energy independence -- all by simply using a\ncleaner fuel and technology that has been commercialized and refined\nover the last 15 years.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n2005-06: S.8015 Serrano Referred to Rules\n2007-09: S.3136 Serrano Referred to En. Con.\n2010:    Senate & Assembly Referred to Environmental Conservation\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nTo be determined.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThe act shall take effect immediately after it shall have become a\nlaw; provided, however, that effective immediately the Commissioner\nof Environmental Conservation is authorized and directed to add,\namend, and/or repeal any rule or regulation necessary for the\nimplementation of this act on its effective date.\n\n",
