Legislative  findings and intent. The legislature hereby finds and\n    5  declares that eminent domain is an important tool for government to move\n    6  forward on important public projects. However, there needs to be a thor-\n    7  ough examination of the eminent domain procedure law to determine if any\n    8  changes need to be made to current law to clarify the rights of property\n    9  owners.  There needs to be a balance between the needs  of  society  and\n   10  the  constitutional  power  of government to exercise its eminent domain\n   11  powers, and the  constitutional  liberty  and  property  rights  of  the\n   12  people.\n   13    2.  A  temporary  state  commission,  to be known as the commission on\n   14  eminent domain reform, hereinafter referred to  as  the  commission,  is\n   15  hereby created to examine, evaluate, and make recommendations concerning\n   16  the  scope and effectiveness of the eminent domain procedure law and the\n   17  legislature's grant to certain public and other entities to exercise the\n   18  power of eminent domain. Specifically the commission  shall  examine  at\n   19  least the following:\n   20    (a)   the   appropriate   constitutional   standard  for  condemnation\n   21  proceedings used for economic development purposes;\n   22    (b) the procedural fairness of  the  eminent  domain  procedure  laws,\n   23  including statutory definitions thereunder;\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD06832-01-1\n\n       S. 1925                             2\n\n    1    (c)  the need for the creation of an eminent domain ombudsman to serve\n    2  as an independent office to safeguard the rights of property owners  and\n    3  provide information regarding the eminent domain procedure law; and\n    4    (d) just compensation provided to affected property owners.\n    5    3.

The legislative leaders  and\n   18  the  governor  shall  make  his or her appointments no later than ninety\n   19  days after the effective date of this act.

The commission may employ and at pleasure remove such personnel as\n   40  it may deem necessary for the performance of its functions and fix their\n   41  compensation within the amounts made available therefor.\n   42    7. The commission may meet within and without the  state,  shall  hold\n   43  public  hearings, and shall have all the powers of a legislative commit-\n   44  tee pursuant to the legislative law.\n   45    8. The commission shall submit its findings and recommendations  in  a\n   46  report  to  the governor, the temporary president of the senate, and the\n   47  speaker of the assembly not later than one year after it first convenes.\n   48    S 2.
