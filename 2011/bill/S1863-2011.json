Paragraph (f) of subdivision 2 and subdivision 4 of section\n    2  400.00  of  the  penal law, paragraph (f) of subdivision 2 as amended by\n    3  chapter 189 of the laws of 2000 and subdivision 4 as amended by  chapter\n    4  331 of the laws of 2005, are amended to read as follows:\n    5    (f) have and carry concealed, without regard to employment or place of\n    6  possession[,  by  any  person  when proper cause exists for the issuance\n    7  thereof]; and\n    8    4. Investigation. Before a license is issued or renewed,  there  shall\n    9  be an investigation of all statements required in the application by the\n   10  duly  constituted police authorities of the locality where such applica-\n   11  tion is made. For that purpose, the records of the appropriate office of\n   12  the department of mental hygiene concerning previous or  present  mental\n   13  illness of the applicant shall be available for inspection by the inves-\n   14  tigating  officer  of the police authority.  THE POLICE AUTHORITY IN THE\n   15  LOCALITY WHERE THE APPLICATION IS MADE SHALL CONDUCT  A  SEARCH  OF  THE\n   16  NATIONAL  INSTANT  CRIMINAL  BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM (NICS). In order to\n   17  ascertain any previous criminal record, the investigating officer  shall\n   18  take  the fingerprints and physical descriptive data in quadruplicate of\n   19  each individual by whom the application  is  signed  and  verified.  Two\n   20  copies of such fingerprints shall be taken on standard fingerprint cards\n   21  eight  inches  square,  and one copy may be taken on a card supplied for\n   22  that purpose by the federal bureau of investigation; provided,  however,\n   23  that in the case of a corporate applicant that has already been issued a\n   24  dealer  in firearms license and seeks to operate a firearm dealership at\n   25  a second or subsequent location, the original fingerprints on  file  may\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD06350-01-1\n\n       S. 1863                             2\n\n    1  be  used  to  ascertain  any criminal record in the second or subsequent\n    2  application unless any of the corporate officers have changed since  the\n    3  prior  application, in which case the new corporate officer shall comply\n    4  with  procedures governing an initial application for such license. When\n    5  completed, one standard card shall be forwarded to and retained  by  the\n    6  division  of  criminal  justice services in the executive department, at\n    7  Albany. A search of the files of such division and written  notification\n    8  of  the results of the search to the investigating officer shall be made\n    9  without unnecessary delay.  Thereafter, such division shall  notify  the\n   10  licensing  officer  and  the  executive  department,  division  of state\n   11  police, Albany, of any criminal record of the  applicant  filed  therein\n   12  subsequent  to  the  search of its files. A second standard card, or the\n   13  one supplied by the federal bureau of investigation, as the case may be,\n   14  shall be forwarded to that bureau at Washington with a request that  the\n   15  files  of  the bureau be searched and notification of the results of the\n   16  search be made to the investigating police  authority.  The  failure  or\n   17  refusal  of  the federal bureau of investigation to make the fingerprint\n   18  check provided for in this section shall not constitute the  sole  basis\n   19  for  refusal  to  issue  a  permit  pursuant  to  the provisions of this\n   20  section. Of the remaining two fingerprint cards, one shall be filed with\n   21  the executive department, division of state police, Albany,  within  ten\n   22  days  after  issuance  of the license, and the other remain on file with\n   23  the  investigating  police  authority.  No  such  fingerprints  may   be\n   24  inspected by any person other than a peace officer, who is acting pursu-\n   25  ant  to  his  special  duties, or a police officer, except on order of a\n   26  judge or justice of a court of record either upon notice to the licensee\n   27  or without notice, as the judge or justice may  deem  appropriate.  Upon\n   28  completion  of  the investigation, the police authority shall report the\n   29  results to the licensing officer without unnecessary delay.\n   30    S 2. This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day  after  it  shall\n   31  have become a law.\n",
