The  legislature  hereby  finds  and\n   24  declares  that  financial  frauds take many forms across multiple indus-\n   25  tries. The legislature further finds that financial  frauds  are  detri-\n   26  mental  to  the  social  and economic well-being of the citizens of this\n   27  state. In order to more thoroughly uncover,  investigate  and  eliminate\n   28  the  myriad financial frauds that may be perpetrated in, and may involve\n   29  the people of, New York state, the legislature finds that it  is  appro-\n   30  priate  that the responsibilities of the insurance frauds bureau and the\n   31  criminal investigations bureau that were administered by the  department\n   32  of  insurance  and the department of banking, respectively, prior to the\n   33  enactment of this article, along with the consumer financial  protection\n   34  activities  of  the consumer protection board be consolidated into a new\n   35  financial frauds and consumer protection unit under the  supervision  of\n   36  the superintendent.\n   37    S  403.

Nothing herein is intended to abrogate or modify in any\n   32  way any common law privilege  or  immunity  heretofore  enjoyed  by  any\n   33  person.\n   34    S 406. Other law enforcement authority, powers and duties not affected\n   35  or impaired. This article shall not:\n   36    (a) Preempt the authority or relieve the duty of other law enforcement\n   37  agencies to investigate and prosecute suspected violations of law;\n   38    (b)  Prevent  or  prohibit  a  person  from voluntarily disclosing any\n   39  information concerning violations of this article to any law enforcement\n   40  agency; or\n   41    (c) Limit any of the powers granted elsewhere in the  banking  law  or\n   42  insurance  law  or other laws to the superintendent or the department to\n   43  investigate possible violations of law  and  take  appropriate  remedial\n   44  action.\n   45    S  407.

This article  shall\n   38  be known and may be cited as the \"insurance frauds prevention act\".\n   39    (a)  The legislature finds and declares that the business of insurance\n   40  directly and indirectly affects all sectors of the public, business  and\n   41  government.  It  further finds that the business of insurance, including\n   42  organization and licensing, the issuance of policies, and the adjustment\n   43  and payment of claims and losses, involve many transactions  which  have\n   44  potential for abuse and illegal activities.\n   45    (b)  [The superintendent and the department have broad authority under\n   46  this chapter to investigate activities which may be  fraudulent  and  to\n   47  develop  evidence  thereon.

That increased capacity, together\n    4  with a more effective monitoring of fire loss claims and payments by the\n    5  insurance  industry  through  centralized  reporting  and  oversight, is\n    6  intended to make it more difficult to perpetrate the crime of  insurance\n    7  fraud by arson.\n    8    S 4.

New York's sentencing  structure  has\n   50  undergone  a  number  of  profound and fundamental changes over the last\n   51  seventeen years. Starting in 1995, the state has moved steadily from  an\n   52  indeterminate  sentencing format to a determinate sentencing format. The\n\n       S. 2812                            76                            A. 4012\n\n    1  state now requires determinate sentences for violent  felony  offenders,\n    2  drug  offenders,  and  sex  offenders who are sentenced to state prison.\n    3  These determinately sentenced offenders are no  longer  eligible  for  a\n    4  discretionary release on parole. Instead, the date of their release from\n    5  prison is governed solely and exclusively by their behavior while incar-\n    6  cerated.\n    7    Similarly,  with  the enactment of the presumptive release statute for\n    8  certain non-violent offenders with indeterminate sentences,  the  parole\n    9  release  decision  is  increasingly  made by corrections officials. As a\n   10  consequence, the board of parole's workload is lighter and its important\n   11  business is being handled by fewer members than are currently authorized\n   12  by law. The board's workload will continue to diminish  as  the  overall\n   13  mix of the inmate population continues to evolve.\n   14    Another  fundamental  change  occurred  in  1996  when the legislature\n   15  changed the penal law to include as an express purpose of  imprisonment,\n   16  the  promotion of inmates' successful and productive reentry into socie-\n   17  ty. Toward this end, many new responsibilities have been placed on  both\n   18  corrections  officials  and  parole officials to ready inmates for their\n   19  release into the community such as: obtaining their  birth  certificates\n   20  and  social security cards prior to release, preparing Medicaid applica-\n   21  tions as warranted, securing identification cards from the department of\n   22  motor vehicles, and providing them with  voter  registration  forms.  In\n   23  addition,  transitional  services programs have now become mandatory for\n   24  all inmates. Transition accountability plans will be developed for  each\n   25  inmate,  starting with their time in general confinement and culminating\n   26  with the inmate's successful reintegration into the community.  Further-\n   27  more, direct linkages with local agencies  have  been  greatly  enhanced\n   28  with the creation of Re-entry Task Forces throughout the state.\n   29    As  a result of the evolution of the sentencing structure and focus on\n   30  reentry the historical separation  of  the  department  of  correctional\n   31  services  and  the division of parole is no longer warranted. In view of\n   32  the commonality of purpose governing the fundamental  missions  of  both\n   33  agencies,  a  single  new  state agency should be created to oversee the\n   34  combined responsibilities of both and, in effect, provide for a seamless\n   35  network for the care, custody, treatment and supervision  of  a  person,\n   36  from  the  day a sentence of state imprisonment commences, until the day\n   37  such person is discharged from supervision in the  community.  This  not\n   38  only  will  enhance  public  safety by achieving better outcomes for the\n   39  greatest number of individuals being released from prison, but also will\n   40  allow for  greater  efficiencies  and  the  elimination  of  duplicative\n   41  responsibilities, thus resulting in significant savings for the state.\n   42    While housed in the new state agency, it is fundamental that the board\n   43  of  parole  retain  its authority to make release decisions based on the\n   44  board members' independent judgment and application of statutory  crite-\n   45  ria.  To  this  end,  the  legislation  makes clear that the board shall\n   46  continue to exercise its independence when determining the  appropriate-\n   47  ness  of  granting  inmates discretionary release to parole supervision.\n   48  The new agency's provision of administrative support will not  undermine\n   49  the board's independent decision-making authority.\n   50    S  1-a.

Further, all or a portion\n   47  of the funds appropriated for the pilot program may  be  transferred  to\n   48  another  state  agency  in  order  to establish positions to perform any\n   49  responsibilities which may be necessary to operate the pilot program.\n   50    4.

Upon receipt of an application filed pursuant to this section, the\n    5  centralized statewide enrollment center shall determine the  eligibility\n    6  of  such  inmate for enrollment in the medical assistance program estab-\n    7  lished under title eleven of article five of the  social  services  law.\n    8  Such  determination shall be based on whether the inmate, except for his\n    9  or her status as an inmate, would be eligible to receive medical assist-\n   10  ance. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of law,  enrollment  in\n   11  the  medical assistance program shall be effective on the date an eligi-\n   12  ble inmate is released, conditionally released or discharged from custo-\n   13  dy in a department facility to  the  community.  The  commissioner,  the\n   14  commissioner  of  the state department of health and the chairman of the\n   15  state [division] BOARD of parole shall determine the process for issuing\n   16  the medical assistance identification card so that  the  applicant  will\n   17  receive appropriate documentation of [his/her] HIS OR HER eligibility of\n   18  medical  assistance either upon release or as soon thereafter as practi-\n   19  cable.\n   20    6.

After the pilot program has been operational for a period of twelve\n   36  months, or sooner if determined to be appropriate by the commissioner, a\n   37  report shall be prepared by the commissioner and submitted to the gover-\n   38  nor, the temporary president of the senate and the speaker of the assem-\n   39  bly  on  the  factors  listed  in  subdivision six of this section.

The commissioner and the commissioner of the department  of  health\n   51  may promulgate rules and regulations necessary for the uniform and time-\n   52  ly preparation, submission, acceptance and processing of applications by\n   53  eligible inmates prior to their release from custody.\n   54    S  17.

Any such revocation shall be upon notice and after an opportu-\n   34  nity to be heard. If the certificate is not so revoked, it shall  become\n   35  a  permanent  certificate  upon expiration or termination of the court's\n   36  authority to revoke the sentence.\n   37    6. Any written report submitted to the court pursuant to this  section\n   38  is confidential and may not be made available to any person or public or\n   39  private  agency except where specifically required or permitted by stat-\n   40  ute or upon specific authorization  of  the  court.

In  granting or revoking a certificate of relief from disabilities\n   47  the action of the [board of parole shall be by  unanimous  vote  of  the\n   48  members  authorized  to  grant or revoke parole. Such action] DEPARTMENT\n   49  shall be deemed a judicial function and shall not be reviewable if  done\n   50  according to law.\n   51    6.
