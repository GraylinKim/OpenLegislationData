  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2350\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the vehicle and traffic law, in relation to distribution of\nhealth care proxy information\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo establish a mechanism for the motor vehicle department to send\nhealth care proxies and information in motor vehicle department\nmailings to New York State residents regarding license and\nregistration renewals and for residents who first register vehicles.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThe Vehicle and Traffic Law is amended to require the Department of\nMotor Vehicles to include health care proxy forms and instructions\ndeveloped by the Department of Health to residents in mailings on\ndrivers' licenses and periodically in mailings on registrations.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nRecent events related to end of life decisions have raised the\nconsciousness of New Yorkers regarding such matters. The need for\nindividuals to make their wishes concerning their health care known\nunder circumstances where such individual is incapable of making\ntheir own end of life decisions is paramount to avoiding\nunnecessary litigation and family strife\" People want to and should\nhave their health care wishes honored. Yet a large majority of New\nYork residents do not have a health care proxy. As a result, their\nhealth care wishes are usually unknown and people are given medical\ntreatment that they would not want or not given treatment that they\nwould want.\n\nTherefore, it is important for the state of New York to establish a\nvariety of ways to provide individuals with health care proxy forms\nand instructions for duly perfecting such proxies to increase the\nnumber of people who complete this important document. It makes sense\nto have the Department of Motor Vehicles, which periodically sends\nmailings to many residents of the state, to include a health care\nproxy form and instructions. This is consistent with what the\nDepartment does now when it provides a place on driver's licenses for\norgan donations.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.3032 of 2009\nS.4881 of 2007\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNominal.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNominal.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
