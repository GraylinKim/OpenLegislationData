It shall also not be a requirement\n   10  that an authorized lender make any reverse mortgage loan to any individ-\n   11  ual who would not qualify for such loan and/or would  not  otherwise  be\n   12  approved for such loan.\n   13    [11] 10. Nothing contained in this section, section six-h of the bank-\n   14  ing  law  or any other provision of law shall be construed to prohibit a\n   15  banking organization or licensed mortgage banker from providing  reverse\n   16  mortgages to homeowners in this state under the federal housing adminis-\n   17  tration's  home  equity  conversion  mortgage  insurance [demonstration]\n   18  program.\n   19    S 2.

The\nchanges reflect realistic practices that exist in New York and across\nthe country. The bill will reduce the costs to seniors that wish to\nobtain a reverse mortgage. It will no longer discriminate against the\nmany seniors that live in cooperative apartments, as it permits such\nseniors to obtain a reverse mortgage\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.4061A 2007-08 -- Referred to Aging.\nS.2035  2009-10 -- Referred to Aging, Advanced to Third Reading\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nMinimal.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
