  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2454\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the volunteer\nfirefighters' benefit law, in relation to the payment of\nbenefits\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo provide for a cost-of-living adjustment to benefits received by\ndisabled volunteer firefighters in New York State.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1. Amends Section 8 of the Volunteer Firefighters' Benefit Law\nby adding a new subsection 2 which reads: Benefits received pursuant\nto subdivision one of this section after January first, two thousand\nten shall be adjusted yearly on February first by a percentage equal\nto the percent increase in the previous year's consumer price index.\n\nSection 2. Subdivision 5 of section 51 of the volunteer firefighters'\nbenefit law is renumbered subdivision 6 and a new subdivision 5 is\nadded to read as follows: The insurance carrier or entity responsible\nfor paying the benefit increase provided in section eight of this\nchapter shall claim for such benefit increase reimbursement from the\nspecial fund for reopened cases commencing one year from the date of\nthe first such payment and annually thereafter while such payments\ncontinue, on a form prescribed by the chair.\n\nSection 3. Sets the enactment date.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nNo existing provisions for a cost-of-living adjustment for benefits\npaid to volunteer firefighters.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nVolunteer firefighters who are injured in the course of their\nvolunteer service are eligible under State law to receive workers'\ncompensation for their injuries. The State has enacted these benefits\nin recognition that these volunteers provide enormously important\nservices to our communities.\n\nChapter 574 of the laws of 1998, raised the benefit level for all\nvolunteer firefighters with permanent total disabilities to the\nmaximum amount of $400 a week regardless of their date of injury.\n\nRecognizing that inflationary forces make it increasingly difficult to\nsubsist on a fixed income, this legislation institutes a\ncost-of-living adjustment for all disabled volunteer firefighters.\nAdequately compensating the men and women, who sacrifice their safety\nand their time to protect the safety of others, for their injuries\n\nincurred in the line of duty is the least we, as a State, can do to\nthank them for their unselfish service.\n\nThis cost-of-living adjustment shall apply to weekly benefit periods\nafter January 1, 2011.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2005-2006: S.1072-B - Passed Both Houses, Veto Memo 288; 2007-2008\n-Local Government.\n2010: S.258 -Referred to Local Government\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to weekly\nbenefit periods that commence after January 1, 2011.\n\n",
