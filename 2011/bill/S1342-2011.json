  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1342\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the insurance law, in relation to the definition of serious\ninjury and determining the sufficiency of the evidence with respect\nthereto\n\nPURPOSE OF BILL:\nTo provide fairness, guidance, clarity and consistency in the\napplication of the law determining \"serious injury\", to more\naccurately and equitably administer the original intent of the\nNo-Fault law.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS OF BILL:\nSection 1- would amend the definition of \"serious injury\" under\n5102(d) Ins. Law as follows: a personal injury which results in\ndeath; dismemberment; significant disfigurement; a fracture; a\npartial or complete tear or impingement of a nerve, tendon, ligament,\nmuscle or cartilage; injury to any part of the spinal column that\nresults in injury to an intervertebral disc; impingement of the\nspinal cord, spinal canal, nerve, tendon or muscle; loss of a fetus;\npermanent total or partial loss of use of a body organ, member,\nfunction or system; a surgical procedure to any injured part of the\nbody; any other permanent consequential limitation of use of a body\norgan, member, function or system; any other significant limitation\nof use of a body organ, member, function or system; or any other\nmedically determined injury or impairment of a permanent or\nnon-permanent nature which prevents the injured person from\nperforming substantially all of the material acts which constitute\nsuch person's usual and customary daily activities for not less than\nninety days during the one hundred eighty days immediately following\nthe occurrence of the injury or impairment. A finding of serious\ninjury under any of the above enumerated categories in this definition\nshall be a sufficient basis for an award for past and/or future\ndamages.\n\nSection 2 would create a new section, &sect;5102-a, as follows:\n\nIssues of fact and sufficiency of the evidence. Whether an- injury\nqualifies as a serious injury pursuant to subdivision (d) of section\nfive thousand one hundred two of this article shall be a question of\nfact. Where evidence is offered as to (a) whether an injury qualifies\nas a serious injury pursuant to subdivision (d) of section five\nthousand one hundred two of this article, or (b) the causation of\nsuch an injury, the sufficiency of such evidence shall be determined\nby the trier of fact. Sufficiency and weight of evidence offered,\nincluding but not limited to that pertaining to qualitative and/or\nquantitative assessment of injury, shall be reserved for the trier of\nfact.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nWhen the legislature originally passed N.Y.S. Ins. Law &sect; 5102, it\nnever intended that New York's citizens would be deprived of their\nconstitutional right to a trial by jury where they actually sustained\na serious injury. The judicial transformation and interpretation of\nthis statute has produced overwhelming obstacles never intended by\nthe legislature and has clogged the courts with boilerplate\n\"threshold motions\" which monopolize judicial resources.\n\nOver the past twenty years developments in technology have enabled\nmedical practitioners to identify injuries to ligaments, tendons,\ntissue, nerves and other non-bony structures through the use of CT\nScans, MRIs, EMGs and other methods. Prior to these advances in\ntechnology significant injuries would not have been revealed or\nadequately appreciated but they are now readily identifiable, and the\nseriousness of their effects are understood far better than ever\nbefore.\n\nUnfortunately, current law has not kept pace with modern medicine. As\na result numerous cases where a serious injury was clearly present\nhave been dismissed because the existing law does not clearly and\nspecifically list and identify such injuries as actionable,\nregardless of how the injury affected the accident victims' lives.\n\nThe proposed amendments would curtail summary dismissal of legitimate\ncases involving significant injuries not objectively verifiable when\nthe law was originally enacted in 1977. The Courts have been flooded\nwith countless motions and extensive appellate practice on the issue\nof whether a serious injury was sustained, resulting in unfair and\ncontradictory decisions and the dismissal of meritorious claims.\nInjured parties in one Judicial Department may have their case\ndismissed as \"non-serious\" while in another Judicial Department a\ncase with similar facts is permitted to proceed.\n\nIn all of the following New York Cases, the courts ruled that based on\nthe current definition and interpretation of \"Serious Injury\" that a\njury was precluded from determining whether a serious i-.jury was\nsustained and therefore the case was dismissed:\n\n*\nMATRA V. RAZA -\na person suffered injuries requiring surgery to both\nknees as a result of an automobile accident;\n\n*\nTAYLOR V. AMERICAN RADIO DISPATCHER, INC., -\nan accident victim\nsustained a tear of the anterior talo-fibular ligament of her ankle\nand a tear of the meniscus of her right knee confirmed by MRI\nrequiring surgery;\n\n*\n\nBYRD V. LIMO -\na person suffered a tear to the musculature of their\nshoulder requiring surgery;\n\n*\nDANVERS V. NEW YORK CITY TRANSIT AUTHORITY,\n- a victim of a motor\nvehicle accident sustained a torn ligament to the ankle that required\nsurgery;\n\n*\nCARTHA V. QUIN -\na person sustained injuries to their elbow requiring\ninvasive surgery;\n\n*\nVALENTIN V. POMILLA -\na person suffered herniated discs to their\nspinal column with consequential nerve damage, which were confirmed\nby objective and positive EMGs, and sustained injury to their right\nknee, which required surgery.\n\nThese and countless other cases like them have all been dismissed by\nour courts for the same reason: despite clearly evident and\ndebilitating injuries being present, these types of injuries have all\nbeen denominated as \"non-serious\" by current judicial interpretations\nof 5102(d) of the Insurance Law.\n\nMoreover, the judiciary has seemingly usurped the authority of the\nLegislature by unilaterally imposing \"requirements\" for proof of a\nserious injury. While the existing statute does not require proof of\ncontemporaneous quantitative testing or require non-stop medical\ntreatment for all victims of vehicular negligence the judiciary has\ncreated these as additional hurdles for an injured person to leap\nover to prove that they are seriously injured.\n\nDecisional law has repeatedly provoked courts to dictate medical\npractices to physicians by imposing these requirements in to the\nvagaries of treatment every time a \"threshold\" motion is interposed.\nHowever, not all judges have approved of this judicial expansion into\nusurping the roles of the Legislature, physicians, and juries. The\njudiciary has repeatedly asked the Legislature for clarification of\nthe statute and firm guidance as to its application, to ensure\nfairness and consistency in applying the \"serious injury threshold\"\nand ease the enormous burden the current law inflicts on the bench\nand upon citizens that have suffered serious injuries.\n\nThe amendments proposed by this Bill would remedy these problems by\nclarifying what qualifies as a \"serious injury\" and promote fairness\nand consistency in its application, taking into account modern\nmedicine and technology which have enabled medical practitioners to\nidentify with more specificity and clarity those injuries having real\n\nand serious consequences. The amendment would further call for jury\ndeterminations on factual issues surrounding the nature and extent of\nthe claims, rather than continuing to hamstring an already\noverburdened judiciary with myriad \"threshold\" motions. Most\nimportantly, these amendments would promote fair, swift, consistent,\nrational, just and easily comprehensible results, in keeping with the\nintent of the original law.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY: 2010 - S.7824/A.10739\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately and shall be applicable to: (i)\nall actions and proceedings commenced on or after the effective date of\nthis act; and (ii) all actions and proceedings commenced prior to the\neffective date of this act and pending on the effective date of this\nact, whereas of such date a trial of the issues thereon has not yet\ncommenced and a dispositive motion has not yet been filed.\n\n",
