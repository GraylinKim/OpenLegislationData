  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1828\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the correction law, in relation to requiring sex offenders\nto register for life and petitions for modification; and to repeal\nsubdivision 2 of section 168-h of such law relating to the duration of\nregistration and verification of certain sex offenders\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill would require all sex offenders to register for\nlife. Eliminates the right of level 3 sex offenders classified as\nsuch on or before March 11, 2002 to petition a court for relief from\nthe duty to register with the sex offender registry.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1- would amend Correction Law &sect; 168-h (1) to delete references\nto the registration period for certain sex offenders and provide that\nall sex offenders must register for life.\n\nSection 2 - would repeal subdivision 2 of section 168-h of the\nCorrection Law, thereby removing the provision authorizing a petition\nfor relief for certain offenders who are registered for 13 years\nor longer.\n\nSection 3 - would repeal subdivision 1 of Correction Law &sect; 168-0\nrelating to a petition for relief; would renumber subdivision 2 of\nCorrection Law &sect; 168-0 as subdivision 1; and would (1) renumber\nsubdivision 3 of Correction Law &sect; 168-0 as subdivision 2; (2) amend\nrenumbered subdivision 2 to authorize a court in which an offender\nhas been convicted of a new offense to hear a petition to modify the\noffender's risk level rather that just the court which determined the\nrisk level; (3) renumber subdivision 4 of Correction Law &sect; 168-o as\nsubdivision 3; and (4) delete a reference to a petition filed\npursuant to subdivision 3 of &sect; 168-o.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nChapter 11 of the laws of 2002 enacted amendments to the\nSex Offender Registration Act which require lifetime registration for\nsexually violent offenders and recidivist sex offenders who receive\ntheir first risk level assignment after March 11, 2002. These\noffenders are not allowed to petition a court for an order relieving\nthem of the lifetime duty to register with the sex offender registry.\nHowever, for those sex offenders classified on or before March 11,\n2002 as a level 3 risk, the most serious risk level, there continues\nto be a right for these offenders to petition the court to be\nrelieved of the duty to register after they have been on the registry\nfor a period of thirteen years.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nWhile some studies indicated that treatment may work for certain\noffenders, other studies have less promising results. Additionally,\nthere is no guarantee that offenders will participate in treatment or\nthat the treatment provided is appropriate for that offender. Given\nthe fact that some offenders can never be rehabilitated and the\nterrible damage inflicted by these repeat offenders, the protection\n\n\nof the public dictates that offenders be required to register for\nlife. Those that demonstrate they are no longer at risk to reoffend\nwill continue to have the opportunity to petition a court for a\nreduction in risk level and corresponding reduction in information\navailable through community notification.\nAmendments enacted to the Sex Offender Registration Act by chapter 11\nof the Laws of 2002 created lifetime registration for sexually\nviolent offenders and recidivist sex offenders who were first\nclassified as such after March 11, 2002. Additionally, these\noffenders have no right to petition a court for relief of this\nlifetime duty to register. These amendments were made in order to\ncomply with provisions of Federal Law.\n\nThe Federal Law requirements did not, however, include a requirement\nthat persons classified as high risk sex offenders before the\neffective date of the amendments cannot petition for relief from the\nduty to register during their lifetime. The result is that the most\ndangerous of sex offenders who were given the level three risk\nassessment on or before March 11, 2002 will still be able to petition\na court for an order relieving them of the duty of lifetime\nregistration after these offenders have been on the registry for a\nperiod of thirteen years. Had these offenders been classified after\nMarch 11, 2002 most would be unable to be relieved of their lifetime\nregistration obligation. This bill will enhance public safety by\ninsuring that those high risk level three sex offenders classified\nbefore March 11, 2002 will not be able to petition the court for\nrelief from the duty to register during their lifetime.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009/2010 - S.1336 Referred to Crime Victims, Crime and Correction\n2007/2008 - S. 2460/A.7538 - Passed Senate,\nNon-Controversial/Assembly Corrections\n2006 - S.495/A.1135 - Senate Crime Victims, Crime and\nCorrection/Assembly Corrections\n2005 - S.495-A/A.1135 - Passed Senate, Non-Controversial/Assembly\nCorrections\n2003/2004 - S.1019/A.6196 - Passed Senate/Assembly Corrections\n2002 - S.6758 - Senate Crime & Corrections\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately, with provisions.\n\n",
