  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2416\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend chapter 174 of the laws of 1968 constituting the New York state\nurban development corporation act, in relation to authorizing the\ncorporation to form a limited liability company for a specific purpose\nand providing for the repeal of such provisions upon expiration\nthereof\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nThis bill would, allow New York State to participate in the federal\nNew Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) Program by creating the necessary\nauthority for the Empire State Development Corporation (ESDC) to form\nlimited liability companies.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nSection 1 of the bill would amend the opening paragraph of &sect; 12 of &sect; 1\nof Chapter 174 of the Laws of 1968 constituting the New York State\nUrban Development Corporation (UDC) Act, to authorize ESDC to form\nLLCs pursuant to Limited Liability Company (LLC) Law &sect; 203 for the\nsole purpose of the participation in the federal NMTC Program. This\nsection would also provide that all projects awarded New Markets Tax\nCredits by ESDC or its subsidiary shall be submitted to the Public\nAuthorities Control Board for approval, in accordance with the\n'provisions of Public Authorities Law &sect; 51. Finally, this section\nwould provide that ESDC report annually on the NMTC Program.\n\nSection 2 of the bill would provide for an immediate effective date,\nas well as a five year sunset provision.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\n\nCurrent law does not permit ESDC to form LLCs.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n2010:  Referred to Corporations, Authorities & Commissions\n       Reported to Finance\n       Passed Senate - Aye: 61  Nay: 0\n\nSTATEMENT IN SUPPORT:\n\nIn May of 2009, ESDC was awarded a $30 million allocation of federal\nNMTCs under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) in\norder to facilitate and increase private sector investment in\neconomic and community\ndevelopment in low income communities. This amendment to the UDC Act\n\nwould permit credits to flow to investors and foster economic\ndevelopment in distressed communities throughout the State.\n\nEnabling ESDC to form LLCs for the purpose in question will enable the\nState to take advantage of a benefit under the federal stimulus\npackage. This benefit comes at no cost to the State. Currently, New\nYork is at a disadvantage relative to other states that take part in\nthe NMTC program. Other states can form LLCs and LLCs are the only\ntype of entity that can effectively utilize the NMTC benefit.\nAccordingly, necessary private investors have no incentive to invest\nin New York projects using the NMTC allocation awarded to ESDC in 2009.\n\nSince the award in May of $30 million from the ARRA, ESDC has\nidentified several eligible projects with funding gaps that could be\nfilled with an NMTC investment. Additionally, the federal government\nis expected to announce another round of NMTC awards in 2010, but New\nYork will not be able to compete for an additional allocation of\nNMTCs until the proposed amendment has been adopted and the current\nallocation is awarded.\n\nBUDGET IMPLICATIONS:\n\nNone to the State. Allocation of this funding will create a\nsignificant economic benefit to underserved communities in the State.\nSince its creation in 2000, the NMTC Program has resulted in the\ninvestment of over $14 billion of private sector capital in low\nincome communities around the country.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis bill would take effect immediately and expire five years later.\n\n",
