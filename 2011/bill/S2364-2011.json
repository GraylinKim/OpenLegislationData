  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2364\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the environmental conservation law, in relation to private\ntrout and black bass hatcheries\n\nPURPOSE:\nThe purpose of this bill is to authorize the sale of\nhatchery-raised trout and black bass for commercial purposes for\nconsumption or resale.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nNew York State law does not currently authorize the sale of\nhatchery-raised trout or black bass for commercial purposes\nfor consumption or resale.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nNew York State law does not currently authorize the sale\nof hatchery-raised trout or black bass for commercial purposes for\nconsumption or resale. Because of this, unlike many other states,\nhatchery-raised trout or black bass are not permitted to be sold to\nrestaurants in New York State. Current law unnecessarily prohibits\nthis business opportunity along with the jobs, tax revenue and other\npotential benefits which would come with it. This bill would remove\nthis prohibition by providing that hatchery permits issued by the\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation would authorize the sale of\nhatchery-raised trout or black bass for commercial purposes for\nconsumption or resale.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.3059 of 2009-10; S.7549 of 2008\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
