  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2453\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nCONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY\nproposing the addition of a new article 20 to the constitution, in\nrelation to providing for initiative and referendum and recall\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo foster greater participatory democracy in New York State by\nallowing voters to: 1) place proposed laws on the ballot for New\nYorkers to adopt or reject (\"initiative\"); 2) place an already\nexisting law on the ballot for New Yorkers to reject or accept\n(\"referendum \"); and 3) place the question of whether to remove and\nreplace a public official on the ballot (\"recall\").\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 and its implementing portions establish the use of\ninitiative in New York State.\nInitiative is defined as the power of electors to propose statutes and\nconstitutional amendments for approval or rejection by the voters. In\nbrief, the initiative measure is submitted by presenting a petition\nto the Secretary of State containing both wording of the initiative\nfor a statute and signatures of electors that constitute at least 5%\nof the total votes cast for all gubernatorial candidates at the last\nelection for governor. If the petition's initiative measure proposes\na constitutional amendment, then the petition must have at least 8%\nof the total votes cast in the last gubernatorial election. Section 2\nand its implementing components authorize referendum in New York.\nReferendum is described as the power of electors to approve or reject\nstatutes (or parts of statutes).\nThis resolution prohibits referendum from being employed in cases of\nurgency statutes (emergency legislation), statutes calling elections\nand statutes authorizing tax levies or appropriations for the State's\ncurrent expenses. A referendum measure shall be proposed by\npresenting to the Secretary of State, within ninety (90) days after\nthe statute to be affected by the proposed referendum has become\neffective, a petition signed by at least 5% of the total votes cast\nfor gubernatorial candidates in the last election for governor. If an\ninitiative or referendum measure is approved by a majority of votes,\nit takes effect the day after the election unless the measure states\notherwise. In the event provisions of two or more measures approved\nat the same election conflict, those provisions of the measure\nreceiving the greater number of affirmative votes shall govern. This\nresolution also permits cities or counties to exercise initiative and\nreferendum powers. Section 6 and its ancillary sections authorize the\nuse of recall in New York State for all statewide elected officers,\nstate senators, assembly members, supreme court judges and trial\ncourt judges. Recall authorizes electors to remove an elective\nofficer. If electors seek to recall a statewide officer, then the\npetition must be signed by at least 12% of the last vote for the\nparticular office. Recall of a state senator, assembly member, and\n\nsupreme and trial court judges shall require signatures equal to at\nleast 20% of the prior vote for the office.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nNew York State is facing several policy challenges in a very difficult\nfiscal climate. While few people would disagree with the common sense\nproposition that it is best to confront such challenges by turning to\nas many people as possible to either propose new legislation or amend\nexisting legislation, New York continues to lag behind more\nprogressive states by failing to enact initiative and referendum\n(\"I and R\"). I and R would engage all New Yorkers by allowing them to\npropose new laws (\"Initiative\") or alter existing ones\n(\"Referendum\") and, if they obtain the requisite support from their\nfellow New Yorkers, place I and R measures on the ballot at elections\nfor all New Yorkers to consider I and R, at its heart, is the means\nto ensure real popular control of public affairs. Since it is the New\nYork populace that is affected by laws enacted in the legislature,\nwhy shouldn't this same populace enjoy the right to approve or reject\nlaws that a majority of New York voters choose to approve or reject.\nThis resolution would help ensure the popular control of public\naffairs by New York citizens through authorizing I and R. However,\nthere are safeguards in the resolution to ensure that an excessive\nnumber of measures do not get on\nthe ballot. Any initiative or referendum measure must obtain at\nleast 5% of all votes cast for governor in the most recent\ngubernatorial election. 5% of the votes cast in the 2002\ngubernatorial contest equals 234,549 persons. As for recall, the\nbasis for this procedure is the well accepted maxim that voters\nshould retain the right of control over their elected officials. No\none would seriously dispute that a candidate for public office may be\nelected for several reasons and some of the reasons may bear very\nlittle relation to the candidate's ability to perform public duties\neffectively. Recall recognizes this by acknowledging that if people\ncan be elected to public office for non-job related reasons, they can\nalso be removed from office for a variety of reasons. Another strong\nargument for establishing I and R and recall in New York is as an\nimportant check on the power of special interests in the State.\nTwenty-four states presently allow citizen initiative measures of some\ntype. As for the argument that I and R and recall can be abused for\nfrivolous reasons or proposals, it must be kept in mind that the\nvoters can reject any measure they are unsure of and, in fact, one\ncould argue that the voters should be trusted to act in the public\ninterest. In sum, direct democracy measures such as I and R and\nrecall can empower New York citizens whenever their elected officials\nignore their concerns.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010 - S.6060 Judiciary Committee/A.6815 Judiciary Committee.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nPossibly slightly increased administrative costs.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nUpon passage by two separately elected Legislatures and approval by\nthe voters after such passage.\n\n",
