  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1916\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the parks, recreation and historic preservation law, in\nrelation to providing for a review process of proposals to alienate\nmunicipal parkland\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nMunicipally owned parkland is vital\nto local communities. Once lost, municipal parkland is difficult to\nrecover. The alienation of municipal parkland should be limited to\ninstances of compelling public need where no other alternative is\navailable, and should be accompanied by replacement parkland.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\n*Defines \"municipal parkland,\" \"municipal parkland alienation,\"\n\"municipality,\" \"parkland alienation legislation,\" \"state or federal\ngrant funding,\" and \"public trust doctrine.\"\n\n*Provides requirements for municipalities seeking to alienate parkland.\n\n*Provides for exemptions when replacement parkland shall not be\nrequired by legislation.\n\n*Provides for necessary language in parkland alienation legislation.\n\n*Provides for a review process by the Office of Parks, Recreation and\nHistoric Preservation in order to alienate municipal parkland.\n\n*Provides that any municipality that has received alienation\nauthorization through enactment of municipal parkland alienation\nlegislation shall submit a report to the Office of Parks, Recreation\nand Historic Preservation.\n\n*Provides for enforcement powers by the attorney general for\nviolations of this act by a municipality.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nFor more than a century, New York courts have held that\nmunicipal parkland is subject to a \"public trust\" for the benefit of\nthe public. As a result, courts have rules that municipal parkland\nmay not be alienated without prior enactment of state legislation\nauthorizing such alienation. This legislation seeks to codify the\npublic trust doctrine and establish a comprehensive program\nadministered by the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic\nPreservation for the alienation of municipal parkland.\n\nMunicipally owned parkland greatly enhances the quality of life,\ncommunity character, and economic vitality of communities throughout\nNew York State by providing healthy, affordable, and educational\n\nopportunities to New Yorkers and tourists. Unfortunately, once lost\nmunicipal parkland is difficult, if not impossible, to recover.\nTherefore, the alienation of parkland should be limited to instances\nof compelling public need where no other alternative is\navailable and should be accompanied by replacement parkland to be made\navailable to the community.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010:  Senate-Advanced to third reading. Assembly - Died in\nLocal Government\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone by the State.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on January 1, 2012.\n\n",
