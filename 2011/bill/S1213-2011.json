  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1213\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act to amend the surrogate's court procedure act, in relation to\nrestricting certain access to records kept by the court\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo prevent mourning survivors from being harassed by vendors.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThis legislation amends subdivision 8 of section 2501 of the surrogate's\ncourt procedure act. persons wishing to examine open surrogate's court\nrecords will be required to fill out a form stating that the records\nwill not be used for a business or commercial purpose. The form will\nrequire disclosure of the person's name, address, telephone number and\npurpose of such inspection. Such person will be required to agree, under\npenalty of perjury, that any information obtained from such books and\nrecords will not be used for business or commercial purposes. It also\nprovides that such person or agent will not contact any member of a\ndecedent's family or any beneficiaries of a decedent except for claims\nand entitlements directly related to the decedent's estate. The\ncompleted forms will be retained by the court.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nPersons who have recently lost loved ones have become the victims of\nbothersome and upsetting phone calls and letters from private investors\nwho are eager to purchase property left to the family through the estate\nor to sell items to survivors. These investors had obtained their infor-\nmation from the surrogate's court open records.  Although the court does\nnot give out phone numbers, it is not difficult for the investors to get\nthis information once they have the other information provided by the\ncourt records. It is unconscionable that grieving family members should\nbe harassed in this way. This legislation will reduce or eliminate this\npractice as, under penalty of perjury, the investors will be prohibited\nfrom contacting the decedent's family except for claims or entitlements\nrelating to the estate.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nThis bill was previously introduced.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nThere will be minimal cost to the surrogate's court to maintain the\nrecords.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the first of January next succeeding the\ndate on which it shall have become law; provided, however, effective\nimmediately, the addition, amendment and/or repeal of any rules or regu-\nlations and the production of forms necessary for the implementation of\nthis act on its effective date are authorized and directed to be made\nand completed on or before such effective date.\n\n",
