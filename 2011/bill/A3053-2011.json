PERRY -- Multi-Sponsored by -- M. of A. COOK,\n         GALEF, HIKIND, HOOPER, LATIMER, LUPARDO, McDONOUGH, SCHROEDER, TITONE,\n         TOWNS, WEISENBERG -- read once and referred to the Committee on  Hous-\n         ing\n\n       AN  ACT  to  amend  the  real  property  law, in relation to cooperative\n         purchase applications\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section  1.  Legislative  findings.  The  legislature hereby finds and\n    2  declares that residential cooperative purchasers are  subject  to  proc-\n    3  esses  and  conditions  that  do  not  also apply to purchasers of other\n    4  single family residences. The legislature also finds  that  these  proc-\n    5  esses  and  conditions,  at  a minimum, give the appearance and have the\n    6  potential to be misused to illegally discriminate against a purchaser of\n    7  cooperative housing. Because this state  strongly  opposes  all  illegal\n    8  discrimination  and  promotes  fair  housing laws and regulations, it is\n    9  essential that the process for purchasing a cooperative dwelling include\n   10  additional safeguards to protect against  illegal  discrimination.  This\n   11  act is not intended and does not diminish the duty of cooperative boards\n   12  to uphold their established fiduciary duties. This act will significant-\n   13  ly  improve  the transparency of the cooperative purchase process to the\n   14  benefit of all parties involved in the transaction.\n   15    S 2. The real property law is amended by adding a new  article  11  to\n   16  read as follows:\n   17                                 ARTICLE 11\n   18                            COOPERATIVE PURCHASE\n   19                                APPLICATIONS\n\n   20  SECTION 360. SHORT TITLE.\n   21          361. DEFINITIONS.\n   22          362. PURCHASE APPLICATIONS.\n   23          363. ACTION UPON APPLICATIONS.\n   24          364.
