  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2495\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the vehicle and traffic law, in relation to the issuance of\ndistinctive plates for the United States merchant marine academy at\nKings Point\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nThis bill allows the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue distinctive\nplates to Alumni of the United States Merchant Marine Academy at\nKings Point.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThe bill amends the vehicle and traffic law by adding a new section\n404-x that creates a distinctive license plate for Alumni of the\nUnited States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point. The plate will\nbear the words \"U.S.\nMerchant Marine Academy at Kings Point\".\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nKings Point is one of the five Federal service academies and requires\na congressional appointment to attend.\nThe United States Merchant Marine Academy is the only institution\nauthorized to carry a battle standard as part of the color guard. The\nbattle standard perpetuates the memory of 142 Academy midshipmen, who\nduring the course of World War II, lost their lives on supply ships\nsunk by U-boats. In addition, Kings Point is still the only Federal\nacademy that sends its students into theaters of war. This\nlegislation will recognize the brave, and often unrecognized, service\nmen and women who attended the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings\nPoint and offer a small token of appreciation to those who served our\ncountry so valiantly.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.7774 of 2010: Referred to Transportation\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the 180th day after it shall have\nbecome a law.\n\n",
