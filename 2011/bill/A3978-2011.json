O'DONNELL, GLICK, BROOK-KRASNY -- Multi-Sponsored\n         by  --  M. of A.  GOTTFRIED -- read once and referred to the Committee\n         on Housing\n\n       AN ACT to amend the private housing finance law and  the  state  finance\n         law,  in  relation  to  dedicating  Mitchell-Lama  buyout  revenues to\n         affordable housing\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section  1. Legislative findings and intent. Mitchell-Lama housing was\n    2  built in the 1950's as a response to the housing crisis after World  War\n    3  II.  This  housing  created new vibrant communities that attracted busi-\n    4  nesses, schools, day care centers and stimulated economic activity  that\n    5  has  allowed  New  York  city to thrive. Without programs like Mitchell-\n    6  Lama, New York City would only be inhabitable for the very rich  or  the\n    7  very  poor. Mitchell-Lama housing allows people of all economic means to\n    8  live together in decent, affordable housing.  This  community  is  being\n    9  threatened  by  the  specter  of  buy-outs. Applying buy-out revenues to\n   10  provide more affordable housing will preserve and promote the well being\n   11  of our state's communities.\n   12    S 2. The private housing finance  law  is  amended  by  adding  a  new\n   13  section 36-b to read as follows:\n   14    S  36-B.  BUYOUT  REVENUES  TO  BE  DEDICATED  TO  AFFORDABLE HOUSING.\n   15  NOTWITHSTANDING ANY INCONSISTENT PROVISION OF LAW, ANY REVENUES  DERIVED\n   16  BY  THE  STATE FROM A BUYOUT OF A STATE-AIDED PROJECT SHALL BE DEPOSITED\n   17  TO THE CREDIT OF THE MITCHELL-LAMA BUYOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND ESTAB-\n   18  LISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION NINETY-TWO-GG OF THE STATE  FINANCE  LAW  AND\n   19  USED  FOR  THE  PURPOSES OF PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO PROJECTS AND\n   20  PERSONS THAT MEET THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA PROVIDED FOR IN THIS  ARTICLE\n   21  AND  NO OTHER. ANY REVENUES DERIVED BY A MUNICIPALITY FROM THE BUYOUT OF\n   22  A MUNICIPALLY-AIDED PROJECT SHALL BE DEPOSITED TO  A  SPECIAL  MUNICIPAL\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD05727-01-1\n\n       A. 3978                             2\n\n    1  FUND  CONSISTING  SOLELY  OF  SUCH REVENUES AND SHALL BE USED SOLELY FOR\n    2  AFFORDABLE HOUSING PURPOSES.\n    3    S 3. The state finance law is amended by adding a new section 92-gg to\n    4  read as follows:\n    5    S  92-GG.  MITCHELL-LAMA  BUYOUT  AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND. 1.
