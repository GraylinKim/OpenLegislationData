ENGLEBRIGHT -- read once and referred to the\n         Committee on Environmental Conservation\n\n       AN ACT to amend the environmental conservation law, in relation  to  the\n         preparation of a comprehensive land use plan for the South Fork Morai-\n         nal  Forest and Hither Hills special groundwater protection areas, and\n         instituting a moratorium  on  development  in  such  areas  until  the\n         adoption of such plan\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature hereby finds that the\n    2  protection of groundwater on the South Fork of Long Island  has  been  a\n    3  policy long enunciated by the state of New York.\n    4    In  1987,  the  legislature  adopted  article  55 of the environmental\n    5  conservation law. This article recognized the  value  of  preparing  and\n    6  implementing  a groundwater watershed protection plan in special ground-\n    7  water protection areas within federally designated sole source aquifers,\n    8  such as the South Fork Morainal Forest  special  groundwater  protection\n    9  area and the Hither Hills special groundwater protection area.\n   10    In  1993,  this  legislature  adopted  the  Long  Island  Pine Barrens\n   11  Protection Act. This act provided for the preparation and implementation\n   12  of a comprehensive land use plan for the Central Pine Barrens area.  The\n   13  implementation of the Central Pine Barrens Plan has been an overwhelming\n   14  success  and  has been nationally recognized for its innovative approach\n   15  to environmental and drinking water protection.\n   16    The Long Island Pine Barrens Protection Act also contained  provisions\n   17  to extend the benefits of its provisions to the South Fork. The towns of\n   18  Southampton  and  East  Hampton,  after initially passing resolutions in\n   19  1999 to participate in such a planning process, have now abandoned  such\n   20  an effort. Further, no comparable planning effort has been completed and\n   21  implemented  by  the  two  towns  to  protect the special drinking water\n   22  protection areas on the South Fork.\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD05269-01-1\n\n       A. 4143                             2\n\n    1    While no plan has been completed and implemented,  historic  increases\n    2  in   development  activity  are  overwhelming  the  special  groundwater\n    3  protection areas and threatening the quality of these vital  groundwater\n    4  resources.\n    5    It is the purpose of this act to stop development within these special\n    6  groundwater  protection  areas  until  a comprehensive land use plan has\n    7  been completed and implemented. This act shall also  set  standards  for\n    8  such a plan and set a timetable for the completion of such a plan.\n    9    S  2.  The  environmental  conservation law is amended by adding a new\n   10  section 57-0126 to read as follows:\n   11  S 57-0126. SOUTH FORK COMPREHENSIVE LAND USE PLAN; MORATORIUM.\n   12    1.
