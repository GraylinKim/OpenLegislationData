  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1843\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nCONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY\nproposing an amendment\nto section 3 of article 7 of the constitution, in relation to requiring\nthat the appropriations bills submitted to the legislature by the\ngovernor set forth with enough specificity each appropriation\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo ensure accountability of public funds by requiring that all\nappropriations bills be specifically itemized by the purpose for\nwhich the funds are to be used.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThis resolution proposes a constitutional amendment (article 7,\nsection 3) to ensure accountability of public funds by requiring that\nall appropriations bills be specifically itemized by the purpose for\nwhich the funds are to be used. The specifications must be in plain\nlanguage and refer to the commonly used names of the programs that\nare to receive the funds and the provision of law authorizing them.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIt has become common practice for state budget bills to appropriate\nfunds in broad and vague categories that do not identify with any\nspecificity or clarity what programs the funds are to be used for and\nthe statutory authorization for the programs. Some bills, such as the\nlegislative appropriations bills in particular, as couched in vague\ngeneralizations. The current system reduces the opportunity for\nlegislators and the public to understand and provide meaningful input\ninto the budget process. It also reduces accountability in the use of\npublic funds.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n04/07/09 REFERRED TO JUDICIARY\n04/17/09 TO ATTORNEY-GENERAL FOR OPINION\n05/08/09 OPINION REFERRED TO JUDICIARY\n01/06/10 REFERRED TO JUDICIARY\n01/12/10 TO ATTORNEY-GENERAL FOR OPINION\n02/02/10 OPINION REFERRED TO JUDICIARY\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nResolved (if the concur), That the foregoing be referred to the first\nregular legislative session convening after the next succeeding\ngeneral election of members of the assembly, and, in conformity with\nsection 1 of article 19 of the constitution, be published for 3\nmonths previous to the time of such election.\n\n",
