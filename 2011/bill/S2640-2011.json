  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2640\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nin relation to authorizing the state comptroller to pay the proceeds of\nthe estate of Howard J. Geyer to any person who can trace a familial\nrelationship through common grandparents with the decedent, and\nproviding for a kinship hearing in the surrogate's court of the county\nof Suffolk to determine persons entitled to such proceeds\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis legislation would allow the estate of Howard Geyer to be\ndistributed among his distant relatives, rather than be held by the\ncomptroller's Office of Unclaimed Funds.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThis is a special act to authorize the New York State Comptrollers to\npay the proceeds of the estate of Howard G. Geyer to certain family\nmembers.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nHoward J. Geyer died without leaving a will; as such his estate was to\nbe distributed according to New York State law. Current law limits\nthe definition of a designee as someone who shares a common\ngrandparent with the deceased. If there is no one to claim the\ninheritance with this familial relationship, the funds remain as\nabandoned property.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009:    S.5358/A.7288\n2007-08: S.3210A/A.6021\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
