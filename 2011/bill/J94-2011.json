  "fulltext" : "\nLEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION honoring Super Casuals upon the occasion of being\nnamed Business of the Year by the Geneva Chamber of Commerce\n\nWHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to honor those busi-\nnesses within the State of New York which distinguish themselves through\noutstanding professional behavior, corporate  innovation,  and  enduring\ncommitment to the community; and\n  WHEREAS,  Attendant to such concern, and in full accord with its long-\nstanding traditions, this Legislative Body  is  justly  proud  to  honor\nSuper  Casuals  upon the occasion of being named Business of the Year by\nthe Geneva Chamber of Commerce, to be celebrated on January 28, 2011, at\nClub 86; and\n  WHEREAS, Super Casuals is celebrating its 60th year  in  business;  it\nhas  earned the honor of Business of the Year due to its long and stable\npresence in Geneva, and the long and generous involvement of its  owners\nand employees in the affairs of the area and its people; and\n  WHEREAS,  Super  Casuals  and  the  Super  Army & Navy Store have been\nanchor stores in downtown Geneva for 60 years;  Josephine  Fragnoli  has\nbeen  there  since  its  inception,  Lou Tandle since 1957, Bob Corcoran\nsince 1975, Joe Fragnoli since 1978, and Steve Fragnoli since 1992; and\n  WHEREAS, Most of the store's 10 employees  are  full-time,  have  many\nyears  with  the  company,  and are well known to many Genevans; truly a\njewel of downtown, this familiarity and loyalty has made  the  store  an\ninformal hang-out and stop for many to discuss the issues of the day and\ncatch up with old friends; and\n  WHEREAS, Super Casuals was founded by Vito Fragnoli in 1950; he worked\nin  a clothing store in Cortland, New York, during high school, and when\nhe finished serving in the Navy after World War II, he  came  to  Geneva\nand was captivated by all the activity generated by the Sampson military\nbase; and\n  WHEREAS,  Vito  Fragnoli  then  talked the owner of the Cortland store\ninto opening a store in Geneva with him, and in  1950  they  opened  the\nGeneva  Super  Army & Navy Store on the east side of Exchange Street; in\n1951, Vito Fragnoli bought out his partner to become the sole  owner  of\nthe business; and\n  WHEREAS,  Vito  Fragnoli needed more room to expand his line of goods,\nand in 1957, he purchased a  building  on  the  west  side  of  Exchange\nStreet, and old Market Basket, tripling the size of his store; his sons,\nJoe, Mark and Steve, still own that building today; and\n  WHEREAS,  In  1970, at the age of 42, Vito Fragnoli died unexpectedly,\nleaving his wife, Josephine, and three sons, then aged 15, 13 and three;\nalthough Josephine had no experience managing the  store,  she  went  to\nwork with the help of Lou Tandle, who had been working at the store with\nVito  since  1957;  Vito's  son Joe was also working after school at the\nstore, and they managed to prosper; and\n  WHEREAS, Joe went off to college and began a career with the Armstrong\nCompany, but in 1978 his mother, Josephine, called to  tell  him  of  an\nopportunity  she  had  in  purchasing a building for the store on Seneca\nStreet; she offered to do it if Joe was interested in returning to Gene-\nva to manage it, and he obviously accepted, and  52  Seneca  Street  was\npurchased moving the store into that location; and\n  WHEREAS,  In  the  1970s, the Fragnoli's business was moving away from\ntraditional Army Navy store goods and into a more casual line,  and,  to\nbetter  reflect this and update its image, in 1981, the name was changed\nto Super Casuals; these particular times  were  when  department  stores\nleft  downtown  areas  for area malls and suburbs, and it was a struggle\nfor a store like Super Casuals to remain and prosper, but it did; and\n\n  WHEREAS, In 1992, Josephine and Vito Fragnoli's other son  Steve,  who\nhad  been  working for IBM after graduating from college, decided it was\nhis turn to return home to the family business, bringing his talents and\nyoung ideas to the store; in 1995, Casey & Sons men's store,  which  had\nrented about a third of the building since the Fragnoli's first move had\nnow  closed; the Fragnoli's took down the wall separating the two store-\nfronts and expanded Super Casuals throughout the entire building; and\n  WHEREAS, Staying with the trends and  needing  to  expand  its  market\nshare,  Super Casuals went into internet sales in 2001, and in 2003, the\nyoungest Fragnoli son, Mark, based in Boston, began  working  full  time\nfor  the company; he manages its website and the technical aspect of the\ninternet sales business, which is a large growing part of the  organiza-\ntion; and\n  WHEREAS, It is with great pleasure that this Legislative Body acknowl-\nedges  Super Casuals' success, recognizes its contributions to the local\nand State economies, and extends its highest commendation to the  corpo-\nration  and  its employees, fully confident that, in its future, it will\nenjoy the same success which has so characterized its past; now,  there-\nfore, be it\n  RESOLVED,  That  this  Legislative  Body pause in its deliberations to\nhonor Super Casuals upon the occasion of being  named  Business  of  the\nYear by the Geneva Chamber of Commerce; and be it further\n  RESOLVED, That a copy of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be tran-\nsmitted to Super Casuals.\n",
