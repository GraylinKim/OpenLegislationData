  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1804\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the social services law, in relation to requiring the provision\nof kitchen facilities in\ncertain locations that temporarily house homeless individuals or accept\ncertain government subsidies\noutside of the city of New York\n\nPURPOSE:\nRequires kitchen facilities in locations that temporarily\nhouse homeless individuals or accept government subsidies to house\nsuch individuals outside of the City of New York.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 20 of the social services law is\namended by adding a new subdivision 9 providing for the Office of\nTemporary and Disability Assistance promulgation and implementation\nof rules and regulations that shall be necessary to require kitchen\nfacilities in locations that \" temporarily house homeless individuals\nor accept government subsidies to house such individuals, located\noutside of the City of New York.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance\nadministers an array of programs to address homelessness in New York\nState. However, there may be instances where homeless individuals\nmust be placed in a temporary shelter until a more permanent place\ncan be found. Many temporary facilities like hotels or motels may not\nbe equipped with on-site kitchen facilities, so they are unable to\nprovide dining services. Accordingly, many individuals are forced to\nfend for themselves which could potentially result in malnutrition\nand hunger. The legislation is necessary to address this problem by\nrequiring the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance to\npromulgate rules and regulations pertaining to mandatory kitchen\nfacilities located in facilities that temporarily house homeless\nindividuals or accept government subsidies to house such individuals\noutside the City of New York.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010:    S.6812\n2005-06: S.585\n2003-04: S.1534\n2001-02: S.7610\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
