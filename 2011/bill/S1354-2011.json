  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1354\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the public authorities law, in relation to the ownership status\nof transit facilities\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\n\nThis bill would correct an unintended loophole in current law which\nallows a small group of MTA New York City Transit (NYCT) employees to\nrecover from their employer in tort for personal injuries for which\nthey have already been fully compensated by workers' compensation\nbenefits.\nThis loophole undermines the basic premise of the workers'\ncompensation framework.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nThis bill amends the public Authorities Law (\"PAL\") to expressly\nprovide that NYCT is the owner of all transit facilities in the City\nof New York solely for purposes of non-delegable duties of property\nowners imposed by state law.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nUnder the PAL provisions creating NYCT, S 1201, ET SEQ Ct, the\nLegislature authorized the City of New York to convey to NYCT by\ndeed, lease, license, or other arrangement all transit facilities\nowned and operated, or thereafter acquired or constructed, by the\nCity and/or the Board of Transportation. In connection with such\nconveyance, NYCT was to assume all legal responsibility therefor, via\nAgreements of Lease (commonly known as the \"Master Leases\"). Because\nthe City accomplished this conveyance via the Master Leases, as\nopposed to deeds, the transit facilities existing at the time of the\ntransfer and those built subsequently with the capital funds (but not\nthese properties financed by MTA or NYCT capital funds) are owned by\nthe City. While the City technically holds title to these facilities,\nthe City retains none of the traditional rights of an owner; NYCT\nretains jurisdiction, control, possession and supervision of the\ntransit facilities. The City may not even terminate a Lease for so\nlong as any debt of the MTA or NYCT relating to transit facilities\nremain outstanding. The City has no say over whether, when and where\nsystem construction will occur and not power to ensure project\nsafety. Further, the Master Leases provide that\nNYCT shall indemnify the City for any judgments arising out of\nownership and control over property subject to a Master Lease when\nand if NYCT ceases using a specific piece of property acquired via a\nMaster Lease. Certain state laws, including Labor Law &sect; 240, et seq.,\nplace non-delegable\n\nduties on property owners absolutely responsible for worker safety in\ninstance involving the performance of certain types of construction\nwork. Labor Law &sect; 240, which is a strict liability statute, is based\non the premise that property and that therefore no negligence need be\nshown to find liability. Further, certain of these state laws,\nincluding Labor Law &sect; 240, do not exempt a fee owner from liability\neven if the property is subject to a net lease and the actual fee\nowner retains none of the actual indices of ownership application of\nthese statutes to be the unique set of facts created by the City's\nlease of transit facilities to NYCT that has produced the inequitable\ncircumstance which this legislation seeks to remedy.\n\nSTATEMENT IN SUPPORT:\nThis bill will eliminate an unintended loophole which results from the\nunique circumstances of the city's lease of transit facilities to\nNYCT combined with the effect of the non-delegable Labor Law\nprovisions and is expected to save NYCT six million ($6,000,000)\ndollars and numerous hours of staff time.\n\nIn November 1997, the New York State Court of Appeals held in the case\nof COLEMAN V. CITY OF NEW YORK, 91 N.Y. 2d 821, 689\nN.E.2d 523, 666\nN.Y.S. 2d 553 (N.Y. 1997), that the City of New York, as fee owner of\ncertain transit facilities, is liable for worker injuries on the\npremises of such facilities which result from a failure to comply\nwith Labor Law &sect; 240, regardless of whether the City had control over\nthe property at the time of such injuries.\nIn essence, COLEMAN\nprovides that injured transit workers are able to recover twice for a\nsingle injury received on the job - first, from NYCT under the\nWorkers' Compensation Law and, second, in tort against the City.\nBecause the Master Leases provide for NYCT indemnification of the\nCity for all damages arising out of NYCT operations, any judgments\nagainst the City resulting from a violation of Labor Law &sect; 240 are in\nfact paid by NYCT. Thus, NYCT ends up paying twice for a single injury.\n\nThe Court of Appeals noted in COLEMAN that\nthe \"Legislature has, in\nthe past, carved out exceptions from liability for certain owners,\"\nand the Court therefore declined to act in place of the Legislature.\nRather, the Court concluded that the Legislature could carve out an\nexception for the City should it choose to and left it up to the\nLegislature to so act. This bill implements the Court of Appeals'\nsuggestion. In so doing, this bill merely corrects an unintended\nloophole, which enables workers to receive a double recovery for a\nsingle injury at the public's expense.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-10:  S.4380/A.1337\n2007-08:  A.560\n2005-06:  A.756\n2003-04:  S.5128/A.1624A\n\n2001-02:  S.5024/A.9574\n1999-00:  S.4487A/A.8770\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nAs noted, this bill would save NYCT and the City of New York the\nexpense of litigation and will save NYCT millions of dollars in\njudgments and settlements.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
