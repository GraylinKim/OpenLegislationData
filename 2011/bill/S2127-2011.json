  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2127\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to establishing criminal negligence\nfor individuals who violate or assist in the violation of any provision\nof the multiple dwelling law where such violation has resulted in the\ndeath of another; and to amend the multiple dwelling law,\nin relation to\nincreasing the penalties for\npersons who violate or assist in the violation of any provision of the\nmultiple dwelling law where such violation has resulted in serious\nphysical injury\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill amends the Penal Law and the Multiple Dwelling Law, imposing\ncriminal penalties for death or serious injury of individuals\nresulting from violations of the multiple dwelling law.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nCurrent law does not provide specific criminal penalties for\nviolations of the Multiple Dwelling Law where such violations result\nin death or serious physical injury.\n\nSection 1 of this bill amends section 125.10 of the penal Law by\nadding a section that finds a person guilty of criminally negligent\nhomicide when a person violates or assists in the violation of any\nprovision of the multiple dwelling law and such violation results in\nthe death of another.\n\nSection 2 of this bill amends section 304 of the Multiple Dwelling Law\nby adding a new subdivision 1-b that provides that every person who\nviolates or assists in the violation of any provision of the multiple\ndwelling law, where such violation results in serious physical injury\nto another person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a\nfine not exceeding two thousand dollars or by imprisonment for a\nperiod not exceeding one year, or by both.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nCurrent provisions of the multiple dwelling law do not provide\nenhanced penalties for violations where such violations result in\nserious physical harm; the penal law does not provide specific\ncharges where violations of the multiple dwelling law result in death.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe problem of illegal apartment conversions is persistent and\npervasive, and places residents of the State in danger of physical\nharm or\ndeath, and puts tremendous strains on community resources, including\nbuilding, fire and emergency medical services personnel. An illegal\nconversion is the creation of one or more additional dwelling units\n\nwithin a building without first receiving the necessary building\npermits.\n\nOn May 7, 2007, a Brooklyn fire claimed the life of a mother and her\none year old son, critically injuring two other family members. The\nillegally converted basement apartment had no smoke detectors and the\nrear exit was sealed shut, according to the New York City Fire\nDepartment.\n\nThis bill also provides District Attorneys with the ability to present\na charge for criminally negligent homicide where violations of the\nmultiple dwelling law results in the death of another. Current\nprovisions of the penal law do not contain a specific section\naddressing such a crime.\n\nAlso, current provisions of the multiple dwelling law do not\ncriminalize violations of that section, regardless of the harm\nresulting from such violations. Under existing law, violations are\npunishable based not upon the severity of the resulting injury, but\nare graduated depending on the number of offenses. This bill\nrecognizes that an illegal conversion is a serious offense, and\nprovides enhanced penalties for those who violate, or assist in\nviolating the multiple dwelling law where serious physical injury\noccurs as a result of such violations.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nNew bill.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nThere would be no fiscal impact.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nThere would be no local fiscal impact.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the first of November next succeeding\nthe date on which it shall have become a law.\n\n",
