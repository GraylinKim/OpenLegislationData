  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1976\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the correction law, in relation to the registration of sex\noffenders\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo make information about all registered sex offenders able\non the Division of Criminal Justice Services home page provide for\nregistration of automatic e-mail notification when offender moves\ninto a resident's zip code.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nSection one of the bill amends subdivision 6 of section 168-b of the\nCorrection Law to change the reference to the subdirectory to a\nreference to the directory of sex offenders.\n\nSection two of the bill amends paragraphs a, band c of subdivision 6\nof section 168-1 of the Correction Law to describe what information\nabout a sex offender is available on the Division homepage depending\non whether the offender has been designated a level one, two or three\nrisk.\n\nSection three of the bill amends section 168-'1 of the Correction Law\nto change the title of the subdirectory to the Directory of Sex\nOffenders and to authorize certain information about level one sex\noffenders to be made available on the Division homepage in addition\nto the current information which is made available on level two and\nthree sex offenders. Also provides that DCJS shall provide on its\ninternet home page a means for a person to register to receive notice\nbye mail whenever a sex offender moves into their zip code.\n\nSection four of the bill provides that it takes effect 180 days after\nit becomes law.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nCurrently, the Sex Offender Registration Act does not\nrequire all sex offenders to be accessible on the DCJS directory\nwebsite. In addition, the Division must maintain a subdirectory of\nSex offenders which is distributed to all local law enforcement\nagencies monthly in addition to being maintained on the Division\nhome page. In order to view the subdirectory, a person must provide\nhis or her name in writing.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIn New York State, a sex offender remains on the Sex\nOffender Registry for at least twenty years. Many offenders are\nrequired to register for life. A subdirectory of Sex Offenders is\nmaintained on the Division of Criminal Justice services homepage.\nWhile this subdirectory\n\nprovides valuable information concerning those offenders who have\nbeen determined to pose a moderate or high risk, no similar\ninformation is provided about offenders found to pose a low risk of\nreoffense. A person must call the 800 number operated by the Division\nor be notified by a local law enforcement agency to learn of low risk\noffenders in the community.\n\nTo use the 800 number, the caller must have the sex offender's name\nand either the offender's exact address, date of birth, social\nsecurity number or driver's license number. There is no fee for the\n800 number.\nThe 800 number has proved to be a useful screening tool for certain\nbusiness and volunteer agencies however, it is not as useful for a\nperson who wishes to know who may pose a threat to the community but\ndoes not know the specific identifying information required for an\n800 number search. Making information about all registered sex\noffenders, based upon risk level, available on the Division home page\nwill expand the utility of the Registry and enhance the safety of New\nYork's most vulnerable citizens. Individuals and organizations who\nneed access to Registry information will be able to obtain such\ninformation from any computer with access to the Internet without\ncharge at a convenient time and will no longer be limited to calling\nthe 800 number. In addition, by providing a mechanism whereby\nresidents may register with DCJS to receive automatic e-mail\nnotifications whenever an offender moves into their zip code will\ngive individuals the peace of mind that they will be timely notified\nwhenever there is an individual who may pose a risk living nearby.\nFurthermore, it takes away the burden of having to check the registry\nall the time to look for new offenders living in the community.\n\nCurrently, a local law enforcement agency is required, by statute, to\nprovide public access to the subdirectory. Agencies accomplish this\nby providing a requestor with the use of a computer to view the\nsubdirectory on the DCJS homepage.\n\nDiscontinuing access to the subdirectory at local law enforcement\nagencies will have little or no impact on the public:. A number of\nlaw enforcement agencies have reported that the subdirectory is\nrarely, if ever, accessed by the public. While the public does not\naccess the subdirectory at a police station very often, the\nsubdirectory maintained on the home page is one of the most\nfrequently visited sites on the Division home page. In December 2006,\nthe subdirectory received 2,113,371 hits. Accessing the subdirectory\nat a law enforcement agency is a cumbersome task. A person wishing to\nview the subdirectory at a police station must ascertain the location\nand time that it is available for viewing. In many cases the viewing\ntimes are limited.\n\nFurther, many citizens may not feel comfortable requesting access at a\npolice station. In contrast, the directory maintained on the Division\nhome page is accessible 24 hours a day from the privacy of home.\nIndividuals who do not have home access to the Internet may access\n\nthe directory at a public library at no charge or any business which\nfurnishes Internet access for a fee. Moreover, any individual who\naccesses the directory from the Internet, may print the results of\nthe search. Printing is often not an option when viewing the\nsubdirectory at a police station.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2003/2004 Similar to S.4007-A Passed  Senate/Assembly Correction\n2005/2006 Similar to S.496-B Passed Senate/Assembly Correction\n02/12/07 Referred to Correction 01/09/08 Referred to Correction\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n180 days after the bill becomes a law.\n\n",
