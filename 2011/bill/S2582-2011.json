  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2582\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the insurance law, in relation to creating a state natural\ndisaster reinsurance fund\n\nSUMMARY:\nThis bill amends the insurance law by adding a new article 80.\nThe purpose of this bill found in Section 8001 is to create a natural\ndisaster reinsurance fund to be financed through voluntary\nparticipation of insurers. The fund will provide subscribing\ncompanies with a pool of available funds to be accessed when a\ncatastrophic event raises claims above a given level and will thus\nreduce the potential for insurance company insolvencies due to\nnatural disasters and other catastrophic events. Section 8002 of this\nbill provides definitions of \"natural disaster\" or \"catastrophic\nevent\" as well as the definition of \"fund\" pursuant to this article.\nSection 8003 states that the superintendent will have custody of the\nnatural disaster reinsurance fund.\n\nAlso, when necessary the state shall establish and adjust the rates\nfor the reinsurance coverage using generally accepted actuarial\nprinciples.\nThe state will hold these funds in trust and shall allow them to be\nabsolved only when participating insurers make claims against the fund.\nSection 8004 provides that participating insurers are eligible to make\nclaims against the fund when a natural disaster, or a series of\nnatural disasters, occurs which results in claims exceeding 15% of\nthe industry's surplus. Section 8005 exempts any amounts deposited\ninto the fund account from taxation by the state or by any county,\nmunicipality or local taxing authority. Section 8006 of this bill\nprohibits participating insurers from increasing any premiums based\nupon payments made to the fund.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThis legislation would create a fund\nwhich insurance\ncompanies can tap into in the case of a natural disaster or\ncatastrophic event. Currently, in the instance of a catastrophic\nevent, insurers must bear the expenses incurred upon them by their\nclients. This bill would prevent insurance company insolvencies\nshould their claims rise above a given level due to natural disasters\nor catastrophic events.\nThis bill is a preventative measure we must make in case of future\ncrisis in this state. This bill provides protection for consumers\nfrom insurance companies raising premiums to cover abundant claims in\nthe event of a natural disaster.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATION:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect January 1, 2012, provided\nhowever, that the\nsuperintendent of insurance shall promulgate any rules\nand regulations necessary for the timely implementation of this act on\nor before its effective date.\n\n",
