  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2644\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the environmental conservation law and the\ngeneral municipal law, in relation to permitting\nthe purchase of renewable energy sources in the awarding of public\ncontracts\n\nPURPOSE:\nProvides that certain contracts for products for public use that\nconsider electricity from renewable sources shall not be subject to\nprovisions regarding the lowest bid.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nSection 1: Amends section 3-0301 of\nthe Environmental Conservation Law by adding a new paragraph (00),\nwhich encourages municipalities to use renewable energy sources when\npurchasing products for public use.\n\nSection 2: Amends section 104-a of the general municipal law by\nincluding renewable energy as a product which may be purchased for\npublic use. The section also defines \"reasonably competitive\" prices\nfor renewable energy as fifteen percent above the cost of a\ncomparable product. This is the same percentage used in defining\n\"reasonably competitive\" for products which a locality can purchase\nif they are composed of at least fifty percent recycled material.\n\nSection 3: Provides the effective date.\n\nPresent law requires public product contracts to be given to the\nlowest responsible bidder. Because of this, contracts for electricity\nfrom renewable energy are rarely considered due to the fact that in\nsome instances renewable energy is more expensive.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nUnder the General Municipal Law,\nproducts which are\nbought for public use must be bought for the lowest bid. However,\nunder Section 104-a, recycled products can be purchased for public\nuse even if they are not the lowest priced product. As the law\ncurrently stands, energy is not included under Section 104-a.\nHowever, the aim of the original law was to promote environmentally\nfriendly purchasing or at minimum not discourage the purchasing of\nenvironmentally friendly products, therefore it makes sense to\ninclude renewable energy. Allowing localities to purchase renewable\nenergy at a slightly higher premium, in lieu of a cheaper but less\necologically sound form of energy, is a logical continuation of the\ncurrent state policy.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\nS.898 of 2005/06;     Referred to Local Government\nS.4472A of 2007/2008; Referred to Environmental Conservation\nS.3855 of 2009/2010;  Referred to Environmental\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the first of January\nnext succeeding the date on which it shall have become a law.\n\n",
