PHEFFER, MARKEY, GABRYSZAK -- Multi-Sponsored by\n         -- M. of A. CLARK, COLTON, COOK, CUSICK, CYMBROWITZ,  FARRELL,  GALEF,\n         GLICK,  HOOPER, MAGEE, MAGNARELLI, MAYERSOHN, McENENY, MILLMAN, ORTIZ,\n         PERRY, SCARBOROUGH, TOWNS, WEISENBERG -- read once and referred to the\n         Committee on Consumer Affairs and Protection\n\n       AN ACT to amend the general business law, in relation to  providing  for\n         notice of compatibility to purchasers of child safety seats\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Legislative findings and purpose. The legislature finds and\n    2  declares that the safest method to transport young children when  riding\n    3  in  passenger  cars  is  in  a federally approved child safety seat. New\n    4  York's mandatory child restraint  law  has  demonstrated  its  value  in\n    5  protecting  young children from fatalities and injuries when involved in\n    6  motor vehicle accidents. It is critical to the  children's  safety  that\n    7  they are protected in a properly fitting child safety seat. The National\n    8  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration  estimates that a properly used\n    9  child safety seat reduces the risk of fatality  by  seventy-one  percent\n   10  and  the  risk  of  serious injury by sixty-seven percent among children\n   11  less than five years of age.\n   12    However, the legislature finds that many child safety  seats  are  not\n   13  used properly. There exist compatibility problems in the design of child\n   14  restraints  that  make secure installation of child safety seats in some\n   15  vehicle seating positions difficult and, occasionally,  impossible.  Not\n   16  all  child  safety seats can be used effectively in all makes and models\n   17  of cars. An improperly installed child safety seat can reduce its poten-\n   18  tial benefits and cause injuries and/or death to children using them.\n   19    Additionally, the legislature finds and declares that consumers should\n   20  be made aware that certain child restraint devices may be  inappropriate\n   21  for certain automobile makes and models.\n   22    Therefore,  the legislature intends by this act to ensure consumers be\n   23  provided information concerning the compatibility of child safety  seats\n   24  with the automobiles in which they will be used.\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD00866-01-1\n\n       A. 844                              2\n\n    1    S  2. The general business law is amended by adding a new section 399-\n    2  ff to read as follows:\n    3    S  399-FF.  CHILD  SAFETY SEATS; LABELING REQUIREMENTS.  1. AS USED IN\n    4  THIS SECTION, THE FOLLOWING TERMS SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:\n    5    (A) \"LABEL\" MEANS A DISPLAY OF WRITTEN, PRINTED OR GRAPHIC MATTER UPON\n    6  THE IMMEDIATE CONTAINER OF ANY CHILD SAFETY SEAT OR IN  THE  CASE  OF  A\n    7  CHILD SAFETY SEAT WHICH IS UNPACKAGED OR IS NOT PACKAGED IN AN IMMEDIATE\n    8  CONTAINER  INTENDED OR SUITABLE FOR DELIVERY TO THE ULTIMATE CONSUMER, A\n    9  DISPLAY OF SUCH MATTER DIRECTLY UPON THE CHILD SAFETY SEAT  INVOLVED  OR\n   10  UPON  A TAG OR SUITABLE MATERIAL AFFIXED THERETO.

NO MANUFACTURER, FIRM, CORPORATION, ASSOCIATION OR AGENT OR EMPLOY-\n   16  EE THEREOF SHALL IMPORT, MANUFACTURE, SELL, HOLD FOR  SALE  OR  DISTRIB-\n   17  UTION  ANY  CHILD SAFETY SEAT INTENDED FOR USE BY A CHILD LESS THAN FOUR\n   18  YEARS OF AGE WHICH FAILS TO CONSPICUOUSLY DISCLOSE ON ITS LABEL A  WARN-\n   19  ING OF COMPATIBILITY OF THE CHILD SAFETY SEAT WITH AUTOMOBILES.\n   20    3.  ANY  CHILD  SAFETY SEAT INTENDED FOR USE BY A CHILD LESS THAN FOUR\n   21  YEARS OF AGE MUST BE LABELED AS FOLLOWS:\n   22  \"ATTENTION:  NOT ALL CHILD SAFETY SEATS ARE COMPATIBLE  WITH  ALL  MOTOR\n   23  VEHICLES.\"\n   24    4.  WHENEVER  THERE  SHALL BE A VIOLATION OF THIS SECTION, APPLICATION\n   25  MAY BE MADE BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE NAME OF  THE  PEOPLE  OF  THE\n   26  STATE OF NEW YORK TO A COURT OR JUSTICE HAVING JURISDICTION BY A SPECIAL\n   27  PROCEEDING  TO  ISSUE AN INJUNCTION, AND UPON NOTICE TO THE DEFENDANT OF\n   28  NOT LESS THAN FIVE DAYS, TO ENJOIN AND RESTRAIN THE CONTINUANCE OF  SUCH\n   29  VIOLATION;  AND  IF  IT SHALL APPEAR TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE COURT OR\n   30  JUSTICE THAT THE DEFENDANT HAS,  IN  FACT,  VIOLATED  THIS  SECTION,  AN\n   31  INJUNCTION  MAY  BE  ISSUED  BY  SUCH  COURT  OR  JUSTICE, ENJOINING AND\n   32  RESTRAINING ANY FURTHER VIOLATION,  WITHOUT  REQUIRING  PROOF  THAT  ANY\n   33  PERSON  HAS,  IN  FACT,  BEEN  INJURED  OR  DAMAGED THEREBY.

WHENEVER  THE  COURT  SHALL  DETERMINE  THAT  A VIOLATION OF THIS\n   38  SECTION HAS OCCURRED, THE COURT MAY IMPOSE A CIVIL PENALTY OF  NOT  MORE\n   39  THAN  ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH VIOLATION, BUT IN NO EVENT SHALL THE\n   40  TOTAL AMOUNT OF SUCH PENALTIES EXCEED TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND  DOLLARS.  IN\n   41  CONNECTION  WITH  ANY SUCH PROPOSED APPLICATION, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS\n   42  AUTHORIZED TO TAKE PROOF AND MAKE A DETERMINATION OF THE RELEVANT  FACTS\n   43  AND  TO  ISSUE  SUBPOENAS  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CIVIL PRACTICE LAW AND\n   44  RULES.\n   45    5.
