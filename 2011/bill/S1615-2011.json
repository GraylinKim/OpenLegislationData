  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1615\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to sexual abuse of a person under\nthe age of thirteen\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA:\nThis bill would strengthen New York State's criminal laws that relate\nto pedophiles by rendering a person guilty of sexual abuse in the\nfirst degree when that person is 18 years old or older and subjects a\nvictim less than 13 years old to sexual contact.\n\nSection One of this bill would amend Section 130.65 of the penal law,\nas amended by Chapter 1 of the Laws of 2000, by providing that a\nperson is guilty of sexual abuse in the first degree when he or she\nis eighteen years old or more and subjects another person to sexual\ncontact who is less that thirteen years old. Section Two of this bill\nwould provide for the effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIn 2001, the New York State Legislature enacted the Sexual Assault\nReform Act. Among the changes made to the Penal Law at that time were\namendments to Rape in the First Degree, Section 130.35(4) and\nCriminal Sexual Act (formerly Sodomy) in the First Degree, Section\n130.50(4).\n\nThese new subdivisions made it a class B violent felony when a\nperpetrator over the age of eighteen had sexual intercourse, anal, or\noral contact with a victim under the age of thirteen. No similar\nchange in age was made at that time to the crime of Sexual Abuse in\nthe First Degree, Section 130.65. That crime is therefore a class D\nviolent felony only when the victim is under the age of eleven.\nConsequently, if a child who is eleven or twelve years old is\nsubjected to sexual contact by an individual who is eighteen or older\nit is merely a class A misdemeanor.\n\nThis legislation would add a subdivision four to Sexual Abuse in the\nFirst Degree, making it a class D violent felony offense, for a child\nunder thirteen to be subjected to sexual contact by a person who is\neighteen years of age or more. Besides protecting these vulnerable\nvictims, this legislation would bring the Sexual Abuse in the First\nDegree statute in line with Rape and Criminal Sexual Act in the First\nDegree. As the law stands in New York State at this moment, a person\nwho puts their hand down the pants of an eleven or twelve year old\nfor purposes of sexual gratification is subjected to the same penalty\nas a person who steals a pack of gum from a convenience store.\n\nThis bill, if enacted, would add New York to the states of\nConnecticut, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Indiana to provide that\n\nsexual contact with an individual who is eleven or twelve years old\nis a felony.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-10: S.5238\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n90 days after it shall have become a law.\n\n",
