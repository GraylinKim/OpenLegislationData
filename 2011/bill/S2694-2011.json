  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2694\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to the related use of a lethal or\nexplosive device\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo impose a sentence of seven years consecutive to whatever\nsentence is imposed on the underlying offense when the defendant\npossesses a lethal device such as a machine gun, pistol, revolver,\nshotgun, rifle, assault weapon, electric dart, stun gun, explosive\ndevice, bomb, grenade, rocket, missile or mine.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThis legislation would add an\nadditional consecutive sentence of seven years onto the sentence of\nan offender who commits any offense while in possession of a lethal\nor explosive device as described in the preceding paragraph.\n\nThat additional seven year sentence will not be imposed if the\ndefendant, within 60 days of arraignment on the indictment or\nsuperior court information, truthfully to the satisfaction of the\ncourt provides the district attorney with all the\ninformation the defendant has concerning the source or the sources of\nthe lethal or explosive device.\n\nThe additional seven year sentence will not be waived when the use of\nthe lethal or explosive device has resulted in the death of or\nserious injury to a person who was not a participant in the offense.\n\nA defendant who qualifies for the waiver will be RULED out and will\nnot have to serve the added consecutive seven year term. Those who\nfail to qualify will be RULED in and will have to serve that\nconsecutive term.\n\nMost of the illegal weapons used against New Yorkers do not lawfully\noriginate within the State of New York and are smuggled into our\nstate by lucrative underground networks. Intelligence garnered\nthrough the truthful debriefings of those who possess such illegal\nweapons while committing other crimes will provide substantial\nassistance to law enforcement in its effort to\ncombat these underground smuggling networks. The ability to gather\nsuch crucially important intelligence will also provide substantial\nassistance to law enforcement in its effort to battle gangs and other\nunderground criminal networks, which enterprises will be severely\nhampered once their criminal members have to fear that a conspirator\narrested with a weapon while committing a crime will have to provide\notherwise\nsecretive intelligence on pain of having to serve an additional seven\nyears consecutive to the prison term imposed on the underlying offense.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2005-06: A.8585  Died in Assembly Codes Committee\n2007-08: A.6495  Died in Assembly Codes Committee\n2009-10: A.6495  Died in Assembly Codes Committee\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nTakes effect on the first November next succeeding the\ndate on which it shall become law.\n\n",
