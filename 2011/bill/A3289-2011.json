Legislative findings and intent. The legislature finds that\n    2  certain students with disabilities are  allowed  extended  testing  time\n    3  according  to their individual education program, or perhaps even accom-\n    4  modations provided pursuant to regulations promulgated under section 504\n    5  of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The legislature  further  finds  that\n    6  these  students,  as a result of this extended time allowance, are being\n    7  subjected to ten or eleven straight  hours  of  testing  when  they  are\n    8  required to take two regents exams on the same date.\n    9    The  legislature  acknowledges  the department of education's need for\n   10  security concerning the substance  of  the  examination.  As  such,  the\n   11  legislature  understands  the department's continuing hesitance to allow\n   12  these students with disabilities to take the exams on  days  other  than\n   13  which they had been officially scheduled.\n   14    However, the benefits of providing these children with respite between\n   15  each exam far outweighs the potential of one of these students garnering\n   16  information about the exam from another student who had previously taken\n   17  the  exam.  Therefore,  it is the intent of this legislature to have the\n   18  commissioner of education implement  a  process  whereby  students  with\n   19  certain  disabilities  are  not  required  to take more than one regents\n   20  examination in any given day.\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD01577-01-1\n\n       A. 3289                             2\n\n    1    S 2. The education law is amended by adding a new section 319 to  read\n    2  as follows:\n    3    S  319.  EXAMINATION  OF  STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. THE COMMISSIONER\n    4  SHALL PROMULGATE REGULATIONS ESTABLISHING GUIDELINES WHICH PROVIDE  THAT\n    5  ANY  CHILD  WHO HAS EXTENDED TESTING TIME PROVISIONS ON HIS OR HER INDI-\n    6  VIDUALIZED EDUCATION PROGRAM, OR  WHO  RECEIVES  EXTENDED  TESTING  TIME\n    7  ACCOMMODATIONS  PURSUANT  TO  SECTION  504  OF THE REHABILITATION ACT OF\n    8  1973, IS PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO ONLY TAKE ONE REGENTS EXAMINATION ON\n    9  ANY GIVEN DAY.\n   10    S 3. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after\n   11  it shall have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition,  amend-\n   12  ment,  and/or  repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the timely\n   13  implementation of this act on its effective date is hereby authorized to\n   14  be made on or before such effective date.\n",
