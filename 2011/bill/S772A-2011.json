  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S772A\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill provides that corn fuel sold for residential heating\npurposes would be exempt from sales and compensating use taxes.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nAmends subdivision (a) of section 1115 of the tax law to add a new\nparagraph 44 to include corn fuel sold for residential heating\npurposes in a compatible fuel appliance.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nHome heating fuels such as natural gas, fuel oil, propane, and wood\npellets are currently exempt from the state sales tax. Shelled kernel\ncorn, which is an alternative fuel option for home heating, should\ntherefore also be exempt from the state sales tax. With energy costs\nat record highs, it is important to better facilitate the use of\nalternative heating sources. Exempting corn heating fuel from sales\nand compensating use tax, as provided by this bill, shall serve as an\nincentive to offer corn as another option for alternative home\nheating fuel.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-2010: S.2488 Reported to Finance\n2007-2008: S.5578/A.1785 Reported to Finance\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the first day of a sales tax quarterly\nperiod, as described in subdivision (b) of section 1136 of the tax\nlaw; next commencing at least 60 days after this act shall have\nbecome a law.\n\n",
