The economic development law is amended  by  adding  a  new\n    2  section 167 to read as follows:\n    3    S  167.  REPORT  ON  THE  ECONOMIC  IMPACT  OF ATV-RELATED TOURISM. 1.\n    4  LEGISLATIVE INTENT. THE  LEGISLATURE  HEREBY  FINDS  AND  DECLARES  THAT\n    5  RIDING  ALL  TERRAIN VEHICLES (ATVS) HAS BECOME A POPULAR OUTDOOR RECRE-\n    6  ATIONAL ACTIVITY IN NEW YORK STATE. HOWEVER, THE LACK  OF  LEGAL  RIDING\n    7  OPPORTUNITIES  AND NEARLY NON-EXISTENT STATE FUNDING ASSISTANCE FOR ATV-\n    8  RELATED ISSUES MAY LIMIT THE ECONOMIC AND TOURISM POTENTIAL OF  ATVS  IN\n    9  NEW  YORK STATE. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE STATE IMPLEMENT AN\n   10  ATV ECONOMIC IMPACT STUDY SO THAT STATE AND  LOCAL  OFFICIALS  HAVE  ALL\n   11  PERTINENT INFORMATION WHEN MAKING ATV-RELATED DECISIONS. A COMPREHENSIVE\n   12  STATEWIDE  STUDY  REGARDING  THE  TOURISM,  ECONOMIC  AND  ENVIRONMENTAL\n   13  IMPACTS OF ATV-RELATED RECREATION WOULD BE A VALUABLE  TOOL  FOR  PUBLIC\n   14  POLICY  MAKERS  AND  DEPARTMENT ADMINISTRATORS IN NEW YORK STATE.  ADDI-\n   15  TIONALLY, ANY STUDY OF ATV  USE  MUST  ALSO  EXAMINE  THE  ENVIRONMENTAL\n   16  IMPACTS  OF  ATVS, INCLUDING ENFORCEMENT ISSUES, REPAIR AND REMEDIATION,\n   17  AS WELL AS POSSIBLE CONFLICTS WITH OTHER USER GROUPS.\n   18    THE LEGISLATURE ALSO FINDS THAT  NON-ATV,  NON-MOTORIZED  RECREATIONAL\n   19  ACTIVITIES  HAVE  A  POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE STATE'S TOURISM AND ECONOMY,\n   20  AND THEREFORE, THIS STUDY WILL ALSO SEEK TO EXAMINE THE ECONOMIC  IMPACT\n   21  OF  POTENTIAL DECREASE IN NON-MOTORIZED TOURISM DUE TO CONFLICTS BETWEEN\n   22  NON-MOTORIZED USER GROUPS AND ATV USERS.\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD01594-01-1\n\n       S. 246                              2\n\n    1    2.
