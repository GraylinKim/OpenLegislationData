It is impossible\nto be fully aware of ones own surroundings when occupied in using an\nelectronic device. This legislation would eliminate this threat to\npublic safety. This legislation is seeking that people take a few\nseconds of their time to stop using their electronic devices while\ncrossing the street. A few seconds that can save a person's life.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall have\nbecome a law.\n\n",
