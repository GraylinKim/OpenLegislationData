A  child  witness  OR A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM WITNESS should be\n   12  declared vulnerable when the court, in accordance with the provisions of\n   13  this section, determines by clear and convincing evidence that the child\n   14  witness OR THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM  WITNESS  would  suffer  serious\n   15  mental  or  emotional  harm  that  would  substantially impair the child\n   16  witness' OR THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM WITNESS' ability to communicate\n   17  with the finder of fact without the use of live, two-way  closed-circuit\n   18  television.\n   19    3.  A  motion pursuant to subdivision one of this section must be made\n   20  in writing at least eight days before the commencement of trial or other\n   21  criminal proceeding upon reasonable notice to the other party  and  with\n   22  an opportunity to be heard.\n   23    4.  The  motion  papers  must  state the basis for the motion and must\n   24  contain sworn allegations of fact which, if true, would support a deter-\n   25  mination by the court that the child witness OR  THE  DOMESTIC  VIOLENCE\n   26  VICTIM  WITNESS  is  vulnerable.  Such allegations may be based upon the\n   27  personal knowledge of the  deponent  or  upon  information  and  belief,\n   28  provided  that, in the latter event, the sources of such information and\n   29  the grounds for such belief are stated.\n   30    5. The answering papers may admit or deny any of the alleged facts and\n   31  may, in addition, contain sworn allegations  of  fact  relevant  to  the\n   32  motion,  including  the rights of the defendant, the need to protect the\n   33  child witness OR THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM WITNESS and the  integrity\n   34  of the truth-finding function of the trier of fact.\n   35    6.  Unless  all  material  facts alleged in support of the motion made\n   36  pursuant to subdivision one of this  section  are  conceded,  the  court\n   37  shall,  in  addition  to examining the papers and hearing oral argument,\n   38  conduct an appropriate hearing for the purpose  of  making  findings  of\n   39  fact essential to the determination of the motion. Except as provided in\n   40  subdivision  [six]  SEVEN  of  this section, it may subpoena or call and\n   41  examine witnesses, who must either testify under oath or be permitted to\n   42  give unsworn testimony pursuant to subdivision two of section  60.20  OF\n   43  THIS  ARTICLE and must authorize the attorneys for the parties to do the\n   44  same.\n   45    7. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the  child  witness  OR\n   46  THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM WITNESS who is alleged to be vulnerable may\n   47  not  be compelled to testify at such hearing or to submit to any psycho-\n   48  logical or psychiatric examination. The failure of the child witness  OR\n   49  THE  DOMESTIC  VIOLENCE  VICTIM WITNESS to testify at such hearing shall\n   50  not be a ground for denying a motion made pursuant to subdivision one of\n   51  this section. Prior statements made by the child witness relating to any\n   52  allegations of conduct constituting an offense defined  in  article  one\n   53  hundred  thirty of the penal law or incest as defined in section 255.25,\n   54  255.26 or 255.27 of such law, or PRIOR  STATEMENTS  MADE  BY  THE  CHILD\n   55  WITNESS  OR THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM WITNESS RELATING to any allega-\n   56  tion of words or conduct constituting an attempt to prevent,  impede  or\n\n       A. 3676                             4\n\n    1  deter  [the child] SUCH witness from cooperating in the investigation or\n    2  prosecution  of  the  offense  shall  be  admissible  at  such  hearing,\n    3  provided, however, that a declaration that a child witness OR A DOMESTIC\n    4  VIOLENCE  VICTIM WITNESS is vulnerable may not be based solely upon such\n    5  prior statements.\n    6    8. (a) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of article forty-five  of\n    7  the  civil practice law and rules, any physician, psychologist, nurse or\n    8  social worker who has treated a child witness  OR  A  DOMESTIC  VIOLENCE\n    9  VICTIM  WITNESS  may testify at a hearing conducted pursuant to subdivi-\n   10  sion [five] SIX of this section concerning the treatment of  such  child\n   11  witness  OR  SUCH  DOMESTIC  VIOLENCE  VICTIM  WITNESS as such treatment\n   12  relates to the issue presented at the hearing, provided that any  other-\n   13  wise  applicable  statutory privileges concerning communications between\n   14  the child witness OR THE  DOMESTIC  VIOLENCE  VICTIM  WITNESS  and  such\n   15  physician,  psychologist, nurse or social worker in connection with such\n   16  treatment shall not be deemed waived by such testimony alone, except  to\n   17  the  limited  extent  of permitting the court alone to examine in camera\n   18  reports, records or documents,  if  any,  prepared  by  such  physician,\n   19  psychologist, nurse or social worker. If upon such examination the court\n   20  determines  that  such  reports,  records  or  documents,  or any one or\n   21  portion thereof, contain information material and relevant to the  issue\n   22  of  whether the child witness OR THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM WITNESS is\n   23  a vulnerable [child] witness, the court shall disclose such  information\n   24  to both the attorney for the defendant and the district attorney.\n   25    (b)  At  any time after a motion has been made pursuant to subdivision\n   26  one of this section, upon the demand of the other party the moving party\n   27  must furnish the demanding party with a copy of  any  and  all  of  such\n   28  records,  reports  or  other  documents  in the possession of such other\n   29  party and must, in addition, supply the court with a copy  of  all  such\n   30  reports, records or other documents which are the subject of the demand.\n   31  At any time after a demand has been made pursuant to this paragraph, the\n   32  moving  party  may demand that property of the same kind or character in\n   33  possession of the party that originally made such demand be furnished to\n   34  the moving party and, if so furnished, be supplied, in addition, to  the\n   35  court.\n   36    9.  (a) Prior to the commencement of the hearing conducted pursuant to\n   37  subdivision five of this section, the district attorney  shall,  subject\n   38  to  a protective order, comply with the provisions of subdivision one of\n   39  section 240.45 of this chapter as they  concern  any  witness  whom  the\n   40  district  attorney  intends to call at the hearing and the child witness\n   41  OR THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM WITNESS.\n   42    (b) Before a defendant calls a witness at  such  hearing,  he  or  she\n   43  must,  subject  to  a  protective  order,  comply with the provisions of\n   44  subdivision two of section 240.45 of this chapter as  they  concern  all\n   45  the witnesses the defendant intends to call at such hearing.\n   46    10.  The  court may consider, in determining whether there are factors\n   47  which would cause the child witness  OR  THE  DOMESTIC  VIOLENCE  VICTIM\n   48  WITNESS  to  suffer serious mental or emotional harm, a finding that any\n   49  one or more of the following  circumstances  have  been  established  by\n   50  clear and convincing evidence:\n   51    (a) The manner of the commission of the offense of which the defendant\n   52  is  accused was particularly heinous or was characterized by aggravating\n   53  circumstances.\n   54    (b) The child witness OR  THE  DOMESTIC  VIOLENCE  VICTIM  WITNESS  is\n   55  particularly  young  or  otherwise particularly subject to psychological\n\n       A. 3676                             5\n\n    1  harm on account of a physical or mental condition which  existed  before\n    2  the alleged commission of the offense.\n    3    (c) At the time of the alleged offense, the defendant occupied a posi-\n    4  tion of authority with respect to the child witness.\n    5    (d)  The offense or offenses charged were part of an ongoing course of\n    6  conduct committed by the defendant against  the  child  witness  OR  THE\n    7  DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM WITNESS over an extended period of time.\n    8    (e)  A deadly weapon or dangerous instrument was allegedly used during\n    9  the commission of the crime.\n   10    (f) The defendant has inflicted serious physical injury upon the child\n   11  witness OR THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM WITNESS.\n   12    (g) A threat, express or implied, of physical violence  to  the  child\n   13  witness  OR  THE  DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM WITNESS, or a third person if\n   14  [the child] SUCH witness were to report the incident to  any  person  or\n   15  communicate information to or cooperate with a court, grand jury, prose-\n   16  cutor,  police officer or peace officer concerning the incident has been\n   17  made by or on behalf of the defendant.\n   18    (h) A threat, express or implied, of the incarceration of a parent  or\n   19  guardian  of  the child witness OR THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM WITNESS,\n   20  the removal of the child witness OR THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM WITNESS\n   21  from the family or the dissolution of the family of the child witness OR\n   22  THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM WITNESS if [the child] SUCH witness were to\n   23  report the incident to any person or communicate information to or coop-\n   24  erate with a court, grand jury,  prosecutor,  police  officer  or  peace\n   25  officer  concerning  the  incident  has been made by or on behalf of the\n   26  defendant.\n   27    (i) A witness other than the child witness OR  THE  DOMESTIC  VIOLENCE\n   28  VICTIM  WITNESS  has  received a threat of physical violence directed at\n   29  such witness or to a third person by or on behalf of the defendant.\n   30    (j) The defendant, at the time of the inquiry, (i) is  living  in  the\n   31  same  household  with  the child witness OR THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM\n   32  WITNESS, (ii) has ready access to the  child  witness  OR  THE  DOMESTIC\n   33  VIOLENCE  VICTIM  WITNESS  or  (iii)  is providing substantial financial\n   34  support for the child witness OR THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM WITNESS.\n   35    (k) The child witness OR THE  DOMESTIC  VIOLENCE  VICTIM  WITNESS  has\n   36  previously  been the victim of an offense defined in article one hundred\n   37  thirty of the penal law or incest as defined in section  255.25,  255.26\n   38  or 255.27 of such law.\n   39    (l)  According  to expert testimony, the child witness OR THE DOMESTIC\n   40  VIOLENCE VICTIM WITNESS would be particularly  [suceptible]  SUSCEPTIBLE\n   41  to  psychological  harm  if  required to testify in open court or in the\n   42  physical presence of the defendant.\n   43    11. Irrespective of whether a motion was made pursuant to  subdivision\n   44  one of this section, the court, at the request of either party or on its\n   45  own  motion,  may  decide  that  a  child witness OR A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE\n   46  VICTIM WITNESS may be vulnerable based on its own  observations  that  a\n   47  child  witness OR A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM WITNESS who has been called\n   48  to testify at a  criminal  proceeding  is  suffering  severe  mental  or\n   49  emotional harm and therefore is physically or mentally unable to testify\n   50  or  to  continue to testify in open court or in the physical presence of\n   51  the defendant and that the use of  live,  two-way  closed-circuit  tele-\n   52  vision  is  necessary  to enable [the child] SUCH witness to testify. If\n   53  the court so decides, it must conduct the same hearing that  subdivision\n   54  [five]  SIX  of  this section requires when a motion is made pursuant to\n   55  subdivision one of this section, and  it  must  make  findings  of  fact\n   56  pursuant  to  subdivisions  [nine  and  eleven]  TEN  AND TWELVE of this\n\n       A. 3676                             6\n\n    1  section, before determining that  the  child  witness  OR  THE  DOMESTIC\n    2  VIOLENCE VICTIM WITNESS is vulnerable.\n    3    12.  In deciding whether a child witness OR A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM\n    4  WITNESS is vulnerable, the court  shall  make  findings  of  fact  which\n    5  reflect the causal relationship between the existence of any one or more\n    6  of  the  factors  set forth in subdivision [nine] TEN of this section or\n    7  other relevant factors which the court finds  are  established  and  the\n    8  determination  that  the  child  witness OR THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM\n    9  WITNESS is vulnerable.  If the court is satisfied that the child witness\n   10  OR THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM WITNESS is vulnerable  and  that,  under\n   11  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the particular case, the defendant's\n   12  constitutional rights to an impartial jury or of confrontation will  not\n   13  be  impaired, it may enter an order granting the application for the use\n   14  of live, two-way closed-circuit television.\n   15    13. When the court has determined that a child witness OR  A  DOMESTIC\n   16  VIOLENCE VICTIM WITNESS is a vulnerable [child] witness, it shall make a\n   17  specific  finding  as  to  whether  placing  the defendant and the child\n   18  witness OR THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM WITNESS in the same room  during\n   19  the  testimony  of  the  child  witness  OR THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM\n   20  WITNESS will contribute to the likelihood that [the child] SUCH  witness\n   21  will  suffer  severe  mental  or emotional harm. If the court finds that\n   22  placing the defendant and the child witness  OR  THE  DOMESTIC  VIOLENCE\n   23  VICTIM  WITNESS  in  the  same  room  during  the testimony of the child\n   24  witness OR THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM WITNESS will contribute  to  the\n   25  likelihood  that  [the  child] SUCH witness will suffer severe mental or\n   26  emotional harm, the  order  entered  pursuant  to  subdivision  [eleven]\n   27  TWELVE  of  this  section  shall direct that the defendant remain in the\n   28  courtroom during the testimony of the vulnerable [child] witness.\n   29  S 65.30 Closed-circuit television; special testimonial procedures.\n   30    1. When the court has entered an order pursuant to  section  65.20  OF\n   31  THIS  ARTICLE,  the testimony of the vulnerable [child] witness shall be\n   32  taken in the testimonial room and the image and voice of the  vulnerable\n   33  [child]  witness,  as  well as the image of all other persons other than\n   34  the operator present in the testimonial room, shall be transmitted  live\n   35  by  means  of  closed-circuit television to the courtroom. The courtroom\n   36  shall be equipped with monitors sufficient to permit  the  judge,  jury,\n   37  defendant  and  attorneys  to  observe  the  demeanor  of the vulnerable\n   38  [child] witness during his or her testimony. Unless  the  courtroom  has\n   39  been  closed pursuant to court order, the public shall also be permitted\n   40  to hear the testimony and view  the  image  of  the  vulnerable  [child]\n   41  witness.\n   42    2.  In  all  instances,  the image of the jury shall be simultaneously\n   43  transmitted to the vulnerable [child] witness in the  testimonial  room.\n   44  If  the  court  order  issued  pursuant to section 65.20 OF THIS ARTICLE\n   45  specifies that the vulnerable [child] witness shall testify outside  the\n   46  physical  presence  of the defendant, the image of the defendant and the\n   47  image and voice of the person examining the vulnerable  [child]  witness\n   48  shall  also  be  simultaneously  transmitted  to  the vulnerable [child]\n   49  witness in the testimonial room.\n   50    3. The operator shall place herself or himself and the  closed-circuit\n   51  television  equipment in a position that permits the entire testimony of\n   52  the vulnerable [child] witness to be transmitted to  the  courtroom  but\n   53  limits  the ability of the vulnerable [child] witness to see or hear the\n   54  operator or the equipment.\n   55    4. Notwithstanding any provision of this article, if the  court  in  a\n   56  particular  case  involving a vulnerable [child] witness determines that\n\n       A. 3676                             7\n\n    1  there is no live, two-way closed-circuit television equipment  available\n    2  in  the court or another court in the county or which can be transported\n    3  to the court from another county or that such equipment,  if  available,\n    4  is  technologically  inadequate  to protect the constitutional rights of\n    5  the defendant, it shall not permit the use of the  closed-circuit  tele-\n    6  vision procedures authorized by this article.\n    7    5. If the order of the court entered pursuant to section 65.20 OF THIS\n    8  ARTICLE  requires that the defendant remain in the courtroom, the attor-\n    9  ney for the defendant and the district attorney shall also remain in the\n   10  courtroom unless the court is  satisfied  that  their  presence  in  the\n   11  testimonial  room will not impede full and private communication between\n   12  the defendant and his or her attorney and will not encourage the jury to\n   13  draw an inference adverse to the interest of the defendant.\n   14    6. Upon request of the defendant, the court shall  instruct  the  jury\n   15  that they are to draw no inference from the use of live, two-way closed-\n   16  circuit television in the examination of the vulnerable [child] witness.\n   17    7.  The  vulnerable [child] witness shall testify under oath except as\n   18  specified in subdivision two of section 60.20 OF THIS ARTICLE. The exam-\n   19  ination and cross-examination of the vulnerable [child]  witness  shall,\n   20  in all other respects, be conducted in the same manner as if the vulner-\n   21  able [child] witness had testified in the courtroom.\n   22    8. When the testimony of the vulnerable [child] witness is transmitted\n   23  from  the  testimonial  room  into the courtroom, the court stenographer\n   24  shall record the [textimony] TESTIMONY in the  same  manner  as  if  the\n   25  vulnerable [child] witness had testified in the courtroom.\n   26    S  2.  This  act  shall take effect immediately and shall apply to all\n   27  criminal actions and proceedings commenced prior to the  effective  date\n   28  of  this  act  but  still  pending  on such date as well as all criminal\n   29  actions and proceedings commenced  on  or  after  such  effective  date.\n   30  Provided  that  the  amendments  to article 65 of the criminal procedure\n   31  law, made by section one of this act, shall not  affect  the  expiration\n   32  and repeal of such article and shall be deemed repealed therewith.\n",
