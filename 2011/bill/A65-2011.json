Subdivision 2 of section  634  of  the  executive  law,  as\n    2  amended  by section 26 of part A-1 of chapter 56 of the laws of 2010, is\n    3  amended to read as follows:\n    4    2. Acceptance of an award made pursuant to this article shall create a\n    5  lien in favor of the state on the proceeds  of  any  recovery  from  the\n    6  person  or  persons  liable  for  the injury or death giving rise to the\n    7  award by the office, whether by judgment, settlement or otherwise, after\n    8  the deduction of the reasonable and  necessary  expenditures,  including\n    9  attorney's  fees,  incurred  in  effecting  such  recovery, to the total\n   10  amount of the award made by the office. Such lien shall  attach  to  any\n   11  moneys  received  or to be received by the claimant or victim on account\n   12  of losses resulting from the crime. Should the claimant or victim secure\n   13  a recovery from the person or persons liable for  the  injury  or  death\n   14  giving  rise to the award by the office, whether by judgment, settlement\n   15  or otherwise, such claimant may, upon notice to the office, apply to the\n   16  court in which the action was instituted, or to any court  of  competent\n   17  jurisdiction  if no action was instituted, for an order apportioning the\n   18  reasonable  and  necessary  expenditures,  including  attorney's   fees,\n   19  incurred  in  effecting such recovery. Such expenditures shall be equit-\n   20  ably apportioned by the court between the claimant and the  office.    A\n   21  copy  of  such  lien  shall  be mailed to the clerk of the county within\n   22  which the crime occurred and such clerk will file the copy in accordance\n   23  with the duties of such clerk as set forth in section five hundred twen-\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD01258-01-1\n\n       A. 65                               2\n\n    1  ty-five of the county law. The amount of such lien may be compromised or\n    2  settled by the office provided the office finds that such action  is  in\n    3  the  best  interests  of the state, or payment of the full amount of the\n    4  lien  to  the state would cause undue hardship for the victim.  NOTWITH-\n    5  STANDING ANY OTHER CONTRARY PROVISION OF LAW, SUCH  LIEN  SHALL  NOT  BE\n    6  INCLUDED  IN  ANY COMPILATION OF SUCH VICTIM'S CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT OR\n    7  CALCULATION OF A CREDIT SCORE OR ASSESSMENT OF ELIGIBILITY FOR  CONSUMER\n    8  CREDIT OR REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE.\n    9    S 2. This act shall take effect immediately.\n",
