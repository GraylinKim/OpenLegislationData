HOWEVER,  IN  NO EVENT SHALL DEBT INCURRED IN FISCAL YEARS\n   29  BEGINNING IN 2019 AND THEREAFTER PURSUANT TO SUCH LAW OR LAWS RESULT  IN\n   30  A  TOTAL  PRINCIPAL  AMOUNT  OF  DEBT  IN EXCESS OF THE LIMIT DETERMINED\n   31  PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION 3 OF THIS  SECTION  OR  THE  DEBT  AFFORDABILITY\n   32  LEVEL ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION 4 OF THIS SECTION.\n   33    6.  ALL  DEBT  SUBJECT  TO  THE  PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION (I) SHALL,\n   34  EXCEPT FOR REFUNDING DEBT,  BE  INCURRED  ONLY  FOR  A  CAPITAL  PURPOSE\n   35  AUTHORIZED BY LAW, AND (II) SHALL, IF INCURRED ON OR AFTER THE FIRST DAY\n   36  OF THE FIRST FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING AT LEAST ONE YEAR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE\n   37  DATE  OF  THIS  SUBDIVISION, BE IN THE FORM OF OBLIGATIONS ISSUED BY THE\n   38  COMPTROLLER.\n   39    7.

DEBT  OBLIGATIONS ISSUED TO REFUND OUTSTANDING STATE DEBT, REGARD-\n    2  LESS OF WHETHER SUCH OUTSTANDING DEBT WAS INCURRED PRIOR TO  THE  EFFEC-\n    3  TIVE  DATE OF THIS SUBDIVISION, SHALL NOT BE COUNTED FOR THE PURPOSES OF\n    4  THE LIMIT IMPOSED BY SUBDIVISION 3 OF THIS SECTION AND THE DEBT AFFORDA-\n    5  BILITY LEVEL REQUIRED BY SUBDIVISION 4 OF THIS SECTION IF SUCH REFUNDING\n    6  COMPLIES  IN  ALL RESPECTS WITH SECTION 13 OF THIS ARTICLE.

AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF  THIS  SECTION  THE  STATE  SHALL  NOT,\n   20  EXCEPT  AS SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZED IN SOME OTHER SECTION OF THIS CONSTI-\n   21  TUTION, AGREE TO MAKE PAYMENTS, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, WHETHER  OR  NOT\n   22  SUBJECT  TO  APPROPRIATION, THAT ARE TO BE AVAILABLE TO PAY DEBT SERVICE\n   23  ON ANY DEBT INCURRED BY A MUNICIPALITY, INDIVIDUAL, PUBLIC AUTHORITY  OR\n   24  OTHER  PUBLIC  OR  PRIVATE  CORPORATION  OR  ANY  OTHER  ENTITY, FOR ANY\n   25  PURPOSE, IF SUCH PAYMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE USED TO  PAY  DEBT  SERVICE\n   26  ONLY  IF  OTHER  SOURCES  AVAILABLE  FOR THE PAYMENT OF DEBT SERVICE ARE\n   27  INADEQUATE.  OUTSTANDING DEBT THAT WOULD BE PROHIBITED BY THIS  SUBDIVI-\n   28  SION  IF  SUCH  DEBT  HAD BEEN INCURRED AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS\n   29  SUBDIVISION MAY BE REFUNDED BY THE ENTITY THAT INCURRED THE  OUTSTANDING\n   30  DEBT  PROVIDED  THAT  ALL  PROVISIONS  OF  SUBDIVISIONS  7 AND 8 OF THIS\n   31  SECTION ARE COMPLIED WITH EXCEPT THE  REQUIREMENT  THAT  SUCH  REFUNDING\n   32  DEBT  OBLIGATIONS  BE  ISSUED  BY  THE  COMPTROLLER,  AND REFUNDING DEBT\n   33  SERVICE EXPENSES SHALL ONLY BE INCLUDED IN THE DEBT AFFORDABILITY  LEVEL\n   34  IF  THE DEBT SERVICE EXPENSES ON THE DEBT BEING REFUNDED WOULD HAVE BEEN\n   35  INCLUDED.\n   36    10. The legislature may, at any time after the ENACTMENT  OR  approval\n   37  of  such  law  [by the people], if no debt shall have been contracted in\n   38  pursuance thereof, repeal the same; and may at any time, by law,  forbid\n   39  the contracting of any further debt or liability under such law.\n   40    S  3.
