McENENY, GALEF, ENGLEBRIGHT, CLARK -- read once\n         and referred to the Committee on Education\n\n       AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to  state  assistance  to\n         school districts for each school age child receiving special education\n         programs and services\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Legislative findings and  purpose.  The  legislature  finds\n    2  that the costs to school districts and, indirectly, to real property tax\n    3  payers for providing special education programs and services is increas-\n    4  ingly  a  burden making the essential educational mission more difficult\n    5  to carry out. The legislature further finds that special education is  a\n    6  health based service and should more appropriately be borne by the state\n    7  government.  Therefore,  it  is the purpose of this act to phase-in over\n    8  five years the assumption by the state of the costs to school  districts\n    9  for  each child receiving special education programs and services and to\n   10  provide that school property taxes be reduced accordingly.\n   11    S 2. Section 3602 of the education law is  amended  by  adding  a  new\n   12  subdivision 21 to read as follows:\n   13    21.

FOR THE SCHOOL YEAR BEGINNING  JULY  FIRST,\n   23  TWO  THOUSAND TWELVE, EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT SHALL RECEIVE THEIR BASE YEAR\n   24  APPORTIONMENT PLUS NOT  LESS  THAN  TWENTY  PERCENT  OF  THE  DIFFERENCE\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD01812-01-1\n\n       A. 2115                             2\n\n    1  BETWEEN  SUCH  APPORTIONMENT  AND  ITS  TOTAL COST FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION\n    2  PROGRAMS.
