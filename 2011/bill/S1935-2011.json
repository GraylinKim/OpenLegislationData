  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1935\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the general municipal law, in relation to the employee benefit\naccrued liability reserve fund\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo allow school districts and other municipal corporations to reduce\nreal property taxes by utilizing excess funds held in Employee\nBenefit Accrued Liability Reserve funds established by Section 6-p of\nthe General Municipal Law.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nAfter audit and certification by the comptroller, that there are funds\nheld in a reserve fund established pursuant to Section 6-p of the\nGeneral Municipal Law in excess of those required to meet\nliabilities, a governing board may use those excess funds to reduce\nreal property taxes and/or voter approved capital projects.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nThe reserve fund established by Section 6-p of the General Municipal\nLaw restricts expenditures solely to compensated absences\nliabilities. There are no provisions in the present statute to deal\nwith fund balances that exceed the amount needed to satisfy\nliabilities.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe Office of the Comptroller has released an audit indicating that\n251 school districts across the State could have \"as much as $407\nmillion more in these reserve funds than they need to pay for\ncompensated absence liabilities\". These excess funds are \"stranded\"\nin these reserve funds because the present law does not allow for\nutilization of these excess funds. This legislation provides that, if\nthe Comptroller audits and certifies that there are excess funds,\nthose monies may be transferred to the General Fund for the purpose\nof reducing real property taxes and/or voter approved capital projects.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-10: S.2520A\n2007-08: S.8787\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to state.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
