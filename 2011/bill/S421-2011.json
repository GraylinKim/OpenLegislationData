KRUEGER, ADAMS, ADDABBO, HASSELL-THOMPSON, HUNTLEY,\n         PERKINS, SQUADRON -- read twice and ordered printed, and when  printed\n         to be committed to the Committee on Elections\n\n       AN ACT to amend the election law, in relation to establishing an instant\n         runoff voting method for certain local elections and providing for the\n         repeal of such provisions upon expiration thereof\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Legislative findings. The current system  of  voting  often\n    2  results  in the election of a candidate that does not  have the majority\n    3  support of the electorate  when  there  are  three  or  more  candidates\n    4  running  for  an elective office. Further, where there are three or more\n    5  candidates for an elective office, voters often will not vote for  their\n    6  preferred  candidate to avoid \"wasting\" their vote on a \"spoiler\" candi-\n    7  date. Rather, they will vote against a candidate they dislike, by voting\n    8  for a leading candidate that they perceive as the lesser of  two  evils.\n    9  The  result  of  the  current system in multi-candidate races can be the\n   10  election of candidates that lack majority support.\n   11    The instant runoff voting method provides for  the  majority  election\n   12  for  elective  offices. Instant runoff voting gives voters the option to\n   13  rank candidates according to the order of their choice. If no  candidate\n   14  obtains  a  majority of first-choice votes, then the candidate receiving\n   15  the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated.  Each  vote  cast  for  the\n   16  eliminated  candidate  shall be transferred to the candidate who was the\n   17  voter's next choice on the ballot. The  process  is  continued  until  a\n   18  candidate receives a majority of votes.\n   19    There  are  several  potential  benefits  to the instant runoff voting\n   20  method. First, voters are free to mark their ballot  for  the  candidate\n   21  they  truly prefer without fear that their choice will  help elect their\n   22  least preferred candidate. Second, it insures that the elected candidate\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD01057-01-1\n\n       S. 421                              2\n\n    1  has true majority support. In addition, the instant runoff voting method\n    2  will (1) promote  higher  voter  turnout,  and  (2)  encourage  positive\n    3  campaigning,  since  candidates will seek second-choice and third-choice\n    4  votes  from  voters  and  will  therefore be less likely to attack other\n    5  candidates and alienate voters that support other  candidates  as  their\n    6  first  choice. In situations where runoffs are already required, it will\n    7  eliminate the need for a second  runoff  election,  with  its  increased\n    8  costs and lower voter turnout.\n    9    The  instant  runoff  voting method has been the subject of increasing\n   10  interest across the nation. It has already been adopted by local  refer-\n   11  enda  in  California,  Vermont, and Massachusetts. It is under consider-\n   12  ation in many other states.\n   13    It is the purpose of this act to permit the use of the instant  runoff\n   14  voting  method on a trial basis in certain local elections at the option\n   15  of local governments in the  years  2011,  2012  and  2013.  This  pilot\n   16  program  would  permit  the  state  legislature  to evaluate the broader\n   17  application of the instant runoff voting method to elections in New York\n   18  state.\n   19    S 2. The election law is amended by adding a new article 18 to read as\n   20  follows:\n   21                                  ARTICLE 18\n   22                        INSTANT RUNOFF VOTING METHOD\n\n   23  SECTION 18-100.
