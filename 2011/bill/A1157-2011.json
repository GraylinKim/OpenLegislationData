Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as\n    2  the \"crime gun identification act of 2011\".\n    3    S 2. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature  finds  that  in\n    4  2005,  the  national clearance rate for homicide cases was approximately\n    5  60% and over 3,000 gun homicide cases went unsolved;  that  in  approxi-\n    6  mately half of gun homicide investigations a spent cartridge casing, but\n    7  not  a firearm, is recovered at the crime scene; that currently deployed\n    8  national ballistic identification systems  cannot  identify  the  serial\n    9  number  of  a gun unless the gun itself has been recovered; that firearm\n   10  microstamping is a revolutionary forensic technology  that  produces  an\n   11  identifiable  alpha-numeric  and  geometric  code  onto  the rear of the\n   12  cartridge casing each time a semiautomatic pistol  is  fired;  that  the\n   13  alpha-numeric  and  geometric  code on an expended cartridge casing will\n   14  provide an initial lead for law enforcement by enabling law  enforcement\n   15  to  match the cartridge casing found at a crime to the original owner of\n   16  the firearm; that information from completed crime  gun  tracing  is  an\n   17  important  element utilized by COMPSTAT and other crime analysis systems\n   18  to target illegal firearms trafficking;  that  microstamping  technology\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD01523-01-1\n\n       A. 1157                             2\n\n    1  continues  to  produce  identifiable  markings  onto  expended cartridge\n    2  casings even after thousands of rounds of testing; that this  additional\n    3  tool  will  help  law  enforcement  investigate illegal gun trafficking,\n    4  close  firearm-related  criminal  cases and protect the public; and that\n    5  legislative action is necessary to require all new semiautomatic pistols\n    6  sold after January 1, 2013 to be microstamp-ready.\n    7    S 3. Section 265.00 of the penal law is  amended  by  adding  two  new\n    8  subdivisions 24 and 25 to read as follows:\n    9    24.  \"MICROSTAMP-READY,\"  WHEN  USED WITH REFERENCE TO A SEMIAUTOMATIC\n   10  PISTOL, MEANS THAT SUCH PISTOL  IS  MANUFACTURED  TO  PRODUCE  A  UNIQUE\n   11  ALPHA-NUMERIC  OR  GEOMETRIC  CODE  ON  AT  LEAST  TWO LOCATIONS ON EACH\n   12  EXPENDED CARTRIDGE CASE THAT IDENTIFIES  THE  MAKE,  MODEL,  AND  SERIAL\n   13  NUMBER OF THE PISTOL.\n   14    25.  \"MICROSTAMPING  COMPONENT OR MECHANISM,\" WHEN USED WITH REFERENCE\n   15  TO A SEMIAUTOMATIC PISTOL, MEANS A COMPONENT OR MECHANISM OF SUCH PISTOL\n   16  DESIGNED AND INTENDED TO PRODUCE A  UNIQUE  ALPHA-NUMERIC  OR  GEOMETRIC\n   17  CODE ON AN EXPENDED CARTRIDGE THAT IDENTIFIES THE MAKE, MODEL, AND SERI-\n   18  AL NUMBER OF THE PISTOL.\n   19    S  4.
