GOLDEN -- read twice and ordered printed, and when\n         printed to be committed to the Committee on Mental Health and Develop-\n         mental Disabilities\n\n       AN ACT to amend the mental hygiene law and the  state  finance  law,  in\n         relation  to  the  reinvestment of funds into community-based services\n         for persons suffering from chemical dependence\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section  1.  Legislative  intent and findings.   The legislature finds\n    2  that declines in the state prison inmate census, due to the  utilization\n    3  of  alternatives to incarceration and changes in the sentencing laws for\n    4  persons convicted of drug offenses, create concomitant demand and strain\n    5  on community-based chemical dependence treatment services.\n    6    The legislature also finds that as state expenditures for incarcerated\n    7  individuals are reduced due to the aforementioned interventions,  it  is\n    8  necessary  and  appropriate  to establish a dedicated fund, comprised of\n    9  those savings, which will be reinvested into the development and  expan-\n   10  sion  of  community-based  chemical  dependence treatment and prevention\n   11  programs.\n   12    The legislature further finds that as  it  is  well  established  that\n   13  chemical  dependence  prevention  and  treatment  is  the most effective\n   14  response to chemical abuse and  addiction  and  the  resulting  criminal\n   15  offenses,   the  availability  of  effective  prevention  and  treatment\n   16  programs should be a prominent component of the state's response.\n   17    S 2. Section 1.03 of the mental hygiene law is amended by adding a new\n   18  subdivision 56 to read as follows:\n   19    56.  \"COMMUNITY  CHEMICAL  DEPENDENCE  REINVESTMENT  SERVICES\"   SHALL\n   20  INCLUDE   CHEMICAL   DEPENDENCE   SERVICES  AS  DEFINED  IN  SUBDIVISION\n   21  FIFTY-FIVE OF THIS SECTION.\n   22    S 3.

  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2201\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the mental hygiene law and the state finance law,\nin relation to the reinvestment of\nfunds into community-based services for persons suffering from chemical\ndependence\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\n\nThis bill, to be known as the Drug Law Reform Reinvestment Act, will\nreinvest savings realized from the reduction in costs associated with\nthe incarceration of drug offenders into community based treatment,\nprevention, education, and job skill training programs for alcohol\nand substance abusers.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\n\nSection 1 providers for the legislative intent and findings as related\nto the decline in the state prison inmate census, due to the\nutilization of alternatives to incarceration and changes in\nsentencing laws for persons convicted of drug offenses, as well as\nthe benefits of chemical dependence prevention.\n\nSection 2 amends the mental hygiene law by adding subdivision 56. This\nsubdivision defines \"community chemical dependence reinvestment\nservices.\"\n\nSection 3 amends the mental hygiene law by adding section 22.12.\nSection 22.12, subdivision (a) provides for the establishment of the\nCommunity Reinvestment Program which directs the Commissioner of the\nOffice of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse to plan, promote, develop,\nevaluate and conduct programs and services of prevention, diagnosis,\nexamination, care, treatment, rehabilitation, education and research\nfor individuals who suffer from and/or are at risk for chemical\ndependence. Subdivision (b) states that all money received or\naccepted pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the chemical\ndependence reinvestment fund. Subdivision (c) states that in\napproving funds pursuant to this section the commissioner of OASAS\nshall consider the extent of local contributions for expenditures for\nlocal services provided to persons diagnosed with chemical\ndependence. Subdivision (d) establishes the state interagency council\non chemical dependence reinvestment fund utilization, which will be\ncharged with development and implementation of a schedule for\nstudying chemical dependence prevention and treatment programs.\n\nSection 4 amends the state finance law by adding section 99-q. This\nsection establishes the Chemical dependence reinvestment fund.\nSubsection 1 establishes a fund in the joint custody of the\n\ncomptroller and the commissioner of taxation and finance to be known\nas the chemical dependence reinvestment fund.\n\nSection 5 states that each year and independent actuarial accounting\nof the savings generated from the declines in the state prison census\nshall be conducted and the results reported to the governor, the\ndivision of the budget, the senate finance committee, and time\nassembly ways and means committee no later than December 31.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nAlcoholism and substance abuse is one of our State and Nation's leading\npublic health problems, costing many billions of dollars and untold\nsuffering in many families and every community. Recent studies by the\nNew York State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services and\nother leading researchers have documented the dramatic successes of\ntreatment and prevention in reducing not just alcohol and drug\ndependence and abuse, but also crime, AIDS, welfare, homelessness and\nother health and social ills.\n\nExpanded alcoholism and substance abuse treatment and prevention will\nbe the linchpin of any successful effort to reform our state's drug\nlaws, as courts and prosecutors must have additional resources\navailable so they can divert appropriate addicted offenders from\nprison. Yet New York State has failed to adequately fund our existing\nbase of alcoholism and substance abuse treatment and prevention\nprograms. These programs have struggled throughout the past decade to\nmaintain their place as the leading providers of those services in\nthe Nation as budget cuts and lack of resources to address inflation\nand additional administrative requirements erode their very\nfoundation. Treatment and prevention programs, as well as vocational\nand job skill training programs need additional resources to be able\nto recruit and retain staff, install computer technology, and\notherwise meet administrative requirements. The goal of assisting the\nmany thousands of addicted offenders and their families who will need\ntreatment, prevention, and job training services as a result of\nRockefeller Drug Law Reform will not be realized unless we stabilize\nour existing community system.\n\nThe Drug Law Reform Reinvestment Act will address all these issues by\nproviding the resources necessary to shore up time existing\nfoundation of our nation-leading alcoholism and substance abuse\ntreatment and prevention system as well as develop the necessary\ncapacity to provide services to the thousands of people diverted from\nprison every year by sentencing reform.\n\nSuccessful outcomes from the treatment of alcoholism and substance\nabuse are to be expected if the addicted individual receives the\nappropriate level of care for the proper duration of time and with\nthe necessary aftercare. The single greatest predictor of treatment\nsuccess is length of stay in treatment. OASAS outcomes data\ndemonstrate dramatic decreases in problem behaviors after six months\n\nin treatment. Drug and alcohol use decreases dramatically as does use\nof expensive healthcare (ER, inpatient hospital stay), arrests,\nincarceration, child abuse and neglect, domestic violence, and other\nundesirable behaviors. Employment increases, dependency on public\nassistance decreases, and quality of life improve after six months or\nmore of treatment.\n\nOASAS licensed community-based treatment is essential for public\nsafety and public health. Releasing inmates or diverting arrestees\nwithout a strong treatment and job training\ncomponent will pose a considerable public risk. Community-based\ntreatment provides a therapeutic structure that increases\ndramatically the likelihood that a person will remain drug/alcohol\nfree and become a law abiding, productive citizen.\n\nThe Drug Reform and Community Reinvestment Act utilizes savings\ncreated by Rockefeller Drug Law Reform to strengthen base funding for\nexisting alcoholism and substance abuse treatment and prevention\nprograms (licensed or approved by OASAS) and to expand those services\nto address the needs of persons targeted by drug law reform and their\nfamilies. The full continuum of OASAS licensed, certified, or\napproved alcoholism and substance abuse treatment, prevention, and\nvocational services will be supported by the reinvestment fund.\nTreatment services include outpatient, day treatment, inpatient,\nresidential, emergency and crisis services, detoxification (inpatient\nand community-based), methadone and other pharmacotherapy, halfway\nhouses and supportive living, aftercare services, services for\nhomeless chemically addicted persons, services for persons with dual\ndisorders, services for chemically-addicted persons with and/or at\nrisk for or HIV infection, HIV-related illness or AIDS, and other\nhard to serve populations. Core treatment services, monitoring and\nreporting progress to the courts, and necessary ancillary services\nwill be eligible for support.\n\nReinvestment is the best way to fund a major initiative to make\ntreatment the first option in addressing behaviors related to\naddiction.\n\nReinvestment has been crucial to the strengthening of New York State's\nmental health system. The experience of time mental health field and\nthe lessons learned about the best way to implement reinvestment\nshould inform time development of Drug Law Reform Community\nReinvestment\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010: S.2193 - Referred to Mental Health & Developmental Disabilities\n2008: S.7228 - Referred to Mental Health & Developmental Disabilities\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis act shall take effect on the first of April next succeeding\nthe date on which it shall have become a law.\n\n",
