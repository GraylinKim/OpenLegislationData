  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1302\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the education law, in relation to\nthe humane treatment of animals\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nTo incorporate the 40 year old roles of the Intel Science Talent\nSearch (formerly the Westinghouse Science Talent Search) regarding\nthe humane treatment of vertebrate animals used in lessons or\nexperimental studies by students, to eliminate the current waiver\nsystem, and to require teachers to inform students of their rights\nunder the law.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 amends subdivisions 4, 5, and 6 of section 809 of the\neducation law and adds a new subdivision 7. Subdivision 4 provides\nthat teachers must notify students of their rights prior to any work\nwith any animal for dissection. subdivision 5 is reworded to include\na definition for \"live vertebrates\" and two exclusions from the ban\non live animal experimentation. subdivision 6 contains language\npertaining to the filing of the \"non-human vertebrate exception form\"\nin cases where animal experimentation is done pursuant to the\nprovisions of this bill for reporting and information reasons.\nSubdivision 7 states that the commissioner shall promulgate rules and\ndevelop such forms as necessary to effectuate the purposes of this\nsection.\n\nSection 2 contains the effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe 1994 amendments to section 809 of the Education Law were intended\nto restrict live vertebrate animal experimentation by high school,\nstudents by banning experimentation in all but a few exceptions.\nAccording to the provisions of this law, waivers were necessary in\norder for students to be involved in experiments on vertebrate\nanimals if those experiments included intrusive or harmful methods.\nSince 1994 however, only three waivers have been applied for, and\ncountless numbers of students who seemingly should have applied for\nwaivers submitted projects to various science fairs without them.\n\nIn response to the inadequacy of the waiver system, new standards,\nsuch as, those of the Intel Science Talent Search (formerly known as\nthe Westinghouse Science Talent Search) should be included. These\nstandards prohibit live animal experimentation with the exception of\nnon invasive studies and those studies in which the student is\nprovided with such components as tissue or blood from an animal which\nis currently under experimentation by researchers These new\nprovisions provide a standardized procedure for the use of animals in\nexperiments.\n\nIn cases where experiments with animals pursuant to the restrictions in\nthe amended law take place, a \"non-human vertebrate exception form\"\nmust be filed With the commissioner of education. This form is not\nsubmitted for permission or for a waiver, instead, these forms\nprovide a basis of knowledge for the Commissioner and legislature in\nregard to the treatment of vertebrate animals in experiments by\nstudents in any school or during any activity conducted under the\nauspices of such school, such as science fair projects. In addition,\nthese changes will help insure more humane care of animals.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2007: S.5408 (Padavan), Died in Education; A.585 (Rosenthal),\nDied in Education\n2008: S.5408 (Padavan), Died in Education; A.585 (Rosenthal),\nDied in Education\n2009: S.3751 (Duane), Died in Education\n2010: S.3751 (Duane), Died in Education\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThe following July after which the bill has been passed into law,\nwith provisions.\n\n",
