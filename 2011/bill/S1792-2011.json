  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1792\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the insurance law, in relation to\ncoverage for treatment of smoking cessation\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo extend health insurance coverage to individuals for whom a physician\nprescribes or orders smoking cessation treatment.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 amends Section 4303 of the Insurance Law by adding a new\nsubsection (1-1) requiring hospital or health service corporations to\nprovide up to $400 worth of coverage for smoking cessation treatment\nordered by a physician.\n\nSection 2 amends subsection (i) of Section 3216 of the Insurance Law by\nadding a new paragraph (25) which requires insurance policies to provide\nup to $400 of coverage for smoking cessation treatment recommended or\nprescribed by a physician.\n\nSection 3 amends subsection (1) of Section 3221 of the Insurance Law by\nadding a new paragraph 17 requiring every group or blanket policy in New\nYork State providing hospital, surgical or medical coverage to include\nup to $400 of coverage for smoking cessation treatment recommended or\nprescribed by a physician.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nTobacco addiction is one of the costliest and most easily avoidable\npublic health problems, requiring Americans and their families to spend\nmillions of dollars every year for the illnesses that are caused by\nsmoking. There are smoking cessation programs that currently are\navailable, however, these highly effective programs are not always\ncovered by either state or private health insurers. Smoking cessation\nprograms are relatively inexpensive when compared to the costly\ntreatments required for victims of smoking-related illnesses. This\nlegislation is necessary for smokers who wish to quit but cannot afford\nto pay all the expenses of such programs on their own. In addition,\nsmoking cessation programs should be made more accessible to those who\nwish to quit smoking, particularly in light of the recent tax increases\non cigarettes in New York State. As the price of cigarettes continues to\nrise, more people will want to stop smoking. Including insurance\ncoverage for smoking cessation programs will make the goal of quitting\nsmoking easier, increase public health and reduce the high expense of\ntreating smoking-related illnesses later in life.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-2010 - A.693\n2007-2008 - A.2321\n2005-2006 - A.4857\n2003-2004 - A.8614\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined. It is expected that the costs of providing coverage\nrequired by this bill to be more than offset by the savings to families\nand state insurance programs in hospital and medical costs.\n\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the 180 day after it\nshall become a law and shall apply to all policies and contracts issued,\nrenewed, modified or amended after such date.\n\n",
