The legislature\n    9  additionally finds that the state of New York has a compelling  interest\n   10  in  determining the causes of these problems and in developing appropri-\n   11  ate remedies.\n   12    S 2. The New York state task force on the condition of African  Ameri-\n   13  can  men  is hereby established. The role of the task force includes but\n   14  is not limited to:\n   15    (a) assessing the causal factors for the condition of African American\n   16  men;\n   17    (b) assessing state programs and initiatives that serve to improve the\n   18  condition of African American men  and  identifying  the  gaps  in  such\n   19  services;\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD04706-01-1\n\n       A. 999                              2\n\n    1    (c)  developing  strategies  to  reduce duplication of services and to\n    2  maximize coordination between state agencies, providers and  educational\n    3  institutions, including developing benchmarks to measure progress; and\n    4    (d) preparing a report for submission to the governor and the legisla-\n    5  ture  that  provides  specific  recommendations regarding existing state\n    6  laws, regulations, programs, policies, and  practices  relating  to  the\n    7  condition of African American men in the state.\n    8    S 3. The task force shall issue its findings, in the form of a report,\n    9  no later than December 31, 2012.\n   10    S  4.

The remaining eight shall\n   17  be appointed, within 60 days of the  effective  date  of  this  act,  as\n   18  follows:    two  shall  be  appointed  by the temporary president of the\n   19  senate; two shall be appointed by the minority leader of the senate; two\n   20  shall be appointed by the speaker of the  assembly;  and  two  shall  be\n   21  appointed  by  the  minority leader of the assembly. The member from the\n   22  office of temporary and disability assistance shall serve as the  direc-\n   23  tor  of the task force and he or she may assign staff as is necessary to\n   24  carry out the provisions of  this  section.  Task  force  members  shall\n   25  receive  no  compensation for their services but shall be reimbursed for\n   26  travel expenses incurred in the performance of their duties.\n   27    S 5. The task force may consult  with  any  organization,  educational\n   28  institution,  governmental agency, or person, that advocates for African\n   29  American men.\n   30    S 6. The director of the task force may reconvene the task force, with\n   31  the same or different members, after issuance of the report, to  address\n   32  any further issues associated with the condition of African American men\n   33  in New York state.\n   34    S  7. All departments or agencies of the state or subdivisions thereof\n   35  shall, at the request of the director, provide the task force with  such\n   36  facilities,  assistance, and data as will enable the task force to carry\n   37  out its powers and duties.\n   38    S 8.
