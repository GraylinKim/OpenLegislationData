  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2684\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the social services law, in relation to the character and\nadequacy of Medicaid assistance and to repeal paragraph (n) of\nsubdivision 2 of section 365-a of the social services law relating to\nthe care and services of audiologists\n\nPURPOSE OF THE BILL:\nModifies the availability of Medicaid services to\nbring them more in line with those of private health insurance\ncoverage.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\n&sect; 1- Amends paragraph (a) of\nsubdivision 2 of &sect; 365-a of the Social Services Law to remove\ndentists, nurses, and private duty nursing from those services\nauthorized under the subdivision. However, nurse midwives and nurse\npractitioners are added.\n\n&sect; 2- Amends paragraph (t) of subdivision 2 of &sect; 365-a of the Social\nServices Law to specify that coverage for preventive, prophylactic\nand other routine dental care, services and supplies will be\nauthorized only when provided in a hospital outpatient or clinic\nfacility. &sect; 3- Amends paragraph (g) of subdivision 2 of\n\n&sect; 365-a of the Social Services Law to remove dental prosthetic\nappliances from those services authorized under the subdivision and\nto authorize the Commissioner of Health to require prior approval of\nany prescription drug that is prescribed for a resident of a nursing\nhome that is not reimbursed as part of the nursing home's Medicaid\nrate.\n\n&sect; 4- Amends paragraph (1) of subdivision 2 of &sect; 365-a of the Social\nServices Law to add clinical psychologists, nurses and audiologists,\nincluding such care and services provided in a hospital outpatient or\nclinic facility, and dentists in those services and care provided in\naccordance with the program of early and periodic screening and\ndiagnosis.\n\n&sect; 5- Repeals paragraph (n) of subdivision 2 of &sect; 365-a of the Social\nServices Law which relates to services provided by audiologists.\n\n&sect; 6- Allows the Commissioner of Health to promulgate or adopt any\nrules or regulations necessary to implement the provisions of the bill.\n\n&sect; 7- Effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nThe ultimate goal of this legislation is to bring\nMedicaid coverage more in line with private health insurance\ncoverage. The costs associated with \"optional\" services, those\nallowed for but not required by the federal government but required\nby New York State, have increased substantially, causing fiscal\nstrife for many of the state's counties. These costs are often passed\nalong to the citizens of the state through higher property taxes or\nother tax increases. This legislation in no way suggests that\nmonetary concerns outweigh the care of individuals. However, it is\nunfair and inappropriate to ask working families to pay for services\ncovered under \"optional\" Medicaid coverage that they themselves may\nnot be able to afford or obtain under their own private health\ninsurance plan.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2007-2008: A.4674\n2005-2006: A.5465-A\n2009-2010: S.7950/A.6677 -- HEALTH/Health\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nYet to be determined. Cost savings to both\ncounties and the State are expected.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nOn the one hundred eightieth day after it shall have\nbecome a law.\n\n",
