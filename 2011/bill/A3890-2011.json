Except as otherwise expressly provided by an act of the legislature\n    5  or by a local law adopted prior to  September  first,  nineteen  hundred\n    6  fifty-three,  all  contracts for public work involving an expenditure of\n    7  more than  thirty-five  thousand  dollars  and  all  purchase  contracts\n    8  involving  an expenditure of more than twenty thousand dollars, shall be\n    9  awarded by the appropriate officer,  board  or  agency  of  a  political\n   10  subdivision  or  of  any district therein including but not limited to a\n   11  soil conservation district, to the lowest responsible bidder  furnishing\n   12  the  required security after advertisement for sealed bids in the manner\n   13  provided by this section; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IN THE CITY OF AUBURN,\n   14  FOR PUBLIC WORKS AND PURCHASE  CONTRACTS  UP  TO  ONE  HUNDRED  THOUSAND\n   15  DOLLARS,  SUCH  CONTRACTS MAY BE AWARDED TO THE RESPONSIBLE BIDDER WHOSE\n   16  BID IS WITHIN FIVE PERCENT OF THE BID OF THE LOWEST  RESPONSIBLE  BIDDER\n   17  AND  IF THE PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS OF SUCH BIDDER IS LOCATED WITHIN\n   18  THE COUNTY OF CAYUGA. In any case where  a  responsible  bidder's  gross\n   19  price  is  reducible  by  an  allowance for the value of used machinery,\n   20  equipment, apparatus or tools to be traded in by  a  political  subdivi-\n   21  sion,  the gross price shall be reduced by the amount of such allowance,\n   22  for the purpose of determining the low bid. In cases where two  or  more\n   23  responsible  bidders  furnishing  the required security submit identical\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD01263-01-1\n\n       A. 3890                             2\n\n    1  bids as to price, such officer, board or agency may award  the  contract\n    2  to any of such bidders.

In determining whether a purchase is an\n    5  expenditure  within  the  discretionary threshold amounts established by\n    6  this subdivision, the officer, board or agency of a  political  subdivi-\n    7  sion  or  of any district therein shall consider the reasonably expected\n    8  aggregate amount of all purchases of the same commodities,  services  or\n    9  technology  to  be made within the twelve-month period commencing on the\n   10  date of purchase.   Purchases of  commodities,  services  or  technology\n   11  shall  not  be  artificially  divided  for the purpose of satisfying the\n   12  discretionary buying  thresholds  established  by  this  subdivision.  A\n   13  change  to or a renewal of a discretionary purchase shall not be permit-\n   14  ted if the change or renewal would bring the reasonably expected  aggre-\n   15  gate  amount of all purchases of the same commodities, services or tech-\n   16  nology from the same provider within the twelve-month period  commencing\n   17  on  the date of the first purchase to an amount greater than the discre-\n   18  tionary buying threshold amount. For purposes of this  section,  \"sealed\n   19  bids\",  as  that  term applies to purchase contracts, shall include bids\n   20  submitted in an electronic format including submission of the  statement\n   21  of  non-collusion  required by section one hundred three-d of this arti-\n   22  cle, provided that the governing board of the political  subdivision  or\n   23  district,  by  resolution,  has  authorized  the receipt of bids in such\n   24  format.  Submission in electronic format may, for  technology  contracts\n   25  only,  be  required  as the sole method for the submission of bids. Bids\n   26  submitted in an electronic format shall be transmitted by bidders to the\n   27  receiving device designated by the political  subdivision  or  district.\n   28  Any  method  used  to  receive electronic bids shall comply with article\n   29  three of the state technology law, and any rules and regulations promul-\n   30  gated and guidelines developed thereunder and, at a  minimum,  must  (a)\n   31  document  the  time  and  date of receipt of each bid received electron-\n   32  ically; (b) authenticate the identity of  the  sender;  (c)  ensure  the\n   33  security  of  the  information transmitted; and (d) ensure the confiden-\n   34  tiality of the bid until the time and date established for  the  opening\n   35  of  bids.  The timely submission of an electronic bid in compliance with\n   36  instructions provided for such submission in the advertisement for  bids\n   37  and/or  the  specifications  shall  be the responsibility solely of each\n   38  bidder or prospective bidder. No political subdivision or district ther-\n   39  ein shall incur any liability from delays of  or  interruptions  in  the\n   40  receiving device designated for the submission and receipt of electronic\n   41  bids.\n   42    S  2.  Subdivision  1  of section 103 of the general municipal law, as\n   43  amended by section 2 of part FF of chapter 56 of the laws  of  2010,  is\n   44  amended to read as follows:\n   45    1. Except as otherwise expressly provided by an act of the legislature\n   46  or  by  a  local  law adopted prior to September first, nineteen hundred\n   47  fifty-three, all contracts for public work involving an  expenditure  of\n   48  more  than  thirty-five  thousand  dollars  and  all  purchase contracts\n   49  involving an expenditure of more than twenty thousand dollars, shall  be\n   50  awarded  by  the  appropriate  officer,  board  or agency of a political\n   51  subdivision or of any district therein including but not  limited  to  a\n   52  soil  conservation district, to the lowest responsible bidder furnishing\n   53  the required security after advertisement for sealed bids in the  manner\n   54  provided  by  this  section.  In  determining  whether  a purchase is an\n   55  expenditure within the discretionary threshold  amounts  established  by\n   56  this  subdivision,  the officer, board or agency of a political subdivi-\n\n       A. 3890                             3\n\n    1  sion or of any district therein shall consider the  reasonably  expected\n    2  aggregate  amount  of all purchases of the same commodities, services or\n    3  technology to be made within the twelve-month period commencing  on  the\n    4  date of purchase. Purchases of commodities, services or technology shall\n    5  not  be  artificially  divided for the purpose of satisfying the discre-\n    6  tionary buying thresholds established by this subdivision. A  change  to\n    7  or  a  renewal of a discretionary purchase shall not be permitted if the\n    8  change or renewal would bring the reasonably expected  aggregate  amount\n    9  of  all  purchases  of the same commodities, services or technology from\n   10  the same provider within the twelve-month period commencing on the  date\n   11  of the first purchase to an amount greater than the discretionary buying\n   12  threshold  amount.  In any case where a responsible bidder's gross price\n   13  is reducible by an allowance for the value of used machinery, equipment,\n   14  apparatus or tools to be traded in by a political subdivision, the gross\n   15  price shall be reduced by the amount of such allowance, for the  purpose\n   16  of  determining  the  low  bid.  In  cases where two or more responsible\n   17  bidders furnishing the required security submit  identical  bids  as  to\n   18  price,  such  officer,  board or agency may award the contract to any of\n   19  such bidders. Such officer, board or agency may,  in  his,  her  or  its\n   20  discretion,  reject  all bids and readvertise for new bids in the manner\n   21  provided by this section; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IN THE CITY OF AUBURN,\n   22  FOR PUBLIC WORKS AND PURCHASE  CONTRACTS  UP  TO  ONE  HUNDRED  THOUSAND\n   23  DOLLARS,  SUCH  CONTRACTS MAY BE AWARDED TO THE RESPONSIBLE BIDDER WHOSE\n   24  BID IS WITHIN FIVE PERCENT OF THE BID OF THE LOWEST  RESPONSIBLE  BIDDER\n   25  AND  IF THE PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS OF SUCH BIDDER IS LOCATED WITHIN\n   26  THE COUNTY OF CAYUGA.\n   27    S 3. This act shall take effect immediately, provided that the  amend-\n   28  ments  to subdivision 1 of section 103 of the general municipal law made\n   29  by section one of this act shall be subject to the expiration and rever-\n   30  sion of such subdivision pursuant to subdivision (a) of  section  41  of\n   31  part  X  of  chapter  62 of the laws of 2003, as amended, when upon such\n   32  date the provisions of section two of this act shall take effect.\n",
