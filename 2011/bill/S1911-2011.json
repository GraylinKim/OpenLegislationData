  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1911\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the criminal procedure law, in relation to the exercise of\nperemptory challenges\n\nSUMMARY:\nThis bill would add a new subdivision one-a  to Criminal\nProcedure Law &sect;270.25 to prescribe a specific procedure by which a\ncriminal trial judge may determine whether a party has engaged in\npurposeful discrimination against prospective jurors in the exercise\nof peremptory challenges. This bill would provide that at any time\nafter jury selection has begun and before the opening statement has\nbeen made to the prosecutor, either party may make a motion in\nwriting or orally for an order discharging the jury panel or for\nother appropriate relief upon the grounds that the other party has\npurposefully discriminated on the basis of race, sex, religion or\nnational origin in the exercise of peremptory challenges. Such motion\nwould be made outside of the hearing of both prospective and sworn\njurors. Each party would be afforded an opportunity to be heard and\nthe court would be required to determine whether the moving party had\nestablished purposeful discrimination on the part of the other party.\nIn those instances where the court determines that a party has\nengaged in purposeful discrimination against prospective jurors in\nthe exercise of peremptory challenges, this bill would permit the\ncourt to seat the juror, discharge the jury panel\nor fashion any other appropriate remedy.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIn April of 1986, the united States\nSupreme Court held\nthat the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution\nforbids a prosecutor to challenge potential jurors based on their race.\n\nBATSON V. KENTUCKY, 476 U.S. 79 (1986). This bill\nwould prohibit\neither party from making peremptory challenges based on a juror's\nrace, sex, religion or national origin. Nevertheless, New York's\nCriminal Procedure Law is silent on the procedure which either a\nprosecutor or a defense lawyer must follow when he or she seeks to\nchallenge juror selection which is believed to have been\nunconstitutionally motivated on the basis of racial discrimination.\nBecause of the law's silence, both lawyers and judges must deal with\nsuch challenges on a case-by-case basis. As a result, practice may\nvary widely from county to county and in some cases, from judge to\njudge.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATION:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the\nfirst of November\nnext succeeding the date on which it shall have become a law and\nshall apply to all jury selections commenced on or after such date.\n\n",
