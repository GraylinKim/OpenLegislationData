LITTLE -- read twice and ordered printed, and when\n         printed to be committed to the Committee on Environmental Conservation\n\n       AN ACT to amend the  environmental  conservation  law,  in  relation  to\n         outdoor wood boilers\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Legislative intent. The legislature finds that  wood  is  a\n    2  sustainable  and renewable resource and that burning clean wood for heat\n    3  reduces our dependence on more costly foreign non-renewable  sources  of\n    4  energy.  The legislature further finds that responsible burning of clean\n    5  wood in an outdoor wood boiler provides a reliable source  of  heat  and\n    6  hot  water at a relatively low cost when compared to other energy sourc-\n    7  es.  Furthermore, the legislature finds that because of the  wide  vari-\n    8  ation  in  climate,  topography,  community character and socio-economic\n    9  conditions throughout New York state, any  regulation  of  outdoor  wood\n   10  boilers that is more restrictive than that contained in this act is most\n   11  appropriately left to local governments.\n   12    S  2.  Article  19 of the environmental conservation law is amended by\n   13  adding a new title 13 to read as follows:\n   14                                  TITLE 13\n   15                     REGULATION OF OUTDOOR WOOD BOILERS\n   16  SECTION 19-1301.

  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2182\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the environmental conservation law, in relation to outdoor wood\nboilers\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nThis bill restricts the sale of\noutdoor wood boilers after January 1, 2011 that do not meet EPA\nemission standards and clarifies statutory authority regarding the\nuse of such as a heating source.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nSection 1. Legislative intent - clarifies that wood is a source of\nclean fuel and when used properly should not be discouraged from\nbeing used as a fuel source.\n\nSection 2 defines clean wood, other biomass, outdoor wood boiler and\nnuisance.\n\nSections 3 - 7. Restricts the fuels that are allowed in outdoor wood\nboilers to clean wood and other biomass, requires outdoor wood\nboilers sold after January 1, 2012 to meet or exceed the particulate\nand emission standards set under EPAs Phase II Voluntary Partnership\nProgram, directs the DEC to publish best practices on the operation,\nuse and siting of outdoor wood boilers, allows local governments to\nmore stringently regulate outdoor wood boilers, and clarifies that\nthe operation of such heating sources is subject to the nuisance\nprovisions of the real property and public health laws.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nWood is a sustainable and renewable source of energy,\nand burning wood reduces our dependence on foreign sources of energy.\nWhen used responsibly, to bum clean wood or other biomass such as\nwood pellets, corn or wood chips, outdoor wood boilers offer many New\nYorkers a reliable and more cost effective source of heat and hot\nwater when compared to the cost of other nonrenewable energy sources.\nFor the most part, the regulation of outdoor wood boilers should be\nleft to local governments who are better able to decide when and\nwhere these units can be used, and are also better positioned to take\nenforcement actions when the operator of such a unit is acting in a\nway that is creating a nuisance situation. Restricting future sales\nof outdoor wood boilers to those units that meet the requirements of\nthe U.S. EPA's Phase 2 Voluntary Partnership Program for outdoor\nwood boilers will ensure that as new units are installed and old\nunits are replaced there will be fewer emissions of particulate matter.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.8061/A.11457 of 2010\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to the state, allowing individuals to use\nsuch heating devices may result in individual savings.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
