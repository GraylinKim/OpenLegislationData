  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1605\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the civil practice law and rules, in relation to providing\npersonal information during disclosure by a person to whom an order of\nprotection has been issued\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo allow victims who have orders of protection to be further\nprotected by keeping personal information confidential in disclosure\nproceedings.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 amends the civil\npractice law and\nrules by adding a new section 3104-a, which protects a domestic\nviolence victim's personal information at a disclosure proceeding.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nNew York State does not do enough to preserve the\nprivacy of domestic violence victims during civil pretrial disclosure\nproceedings.\nWitnesses who are called to provide information under oath are often\nasked during these formal proceedings questions that unreasonably\ninvade the privacy and jeopardize the safety and security of victims\nof domestic violence questions of residency, employment, and family\nrelationships. Legal protections need to extend to these out-of-court\ncivil proceedings to maximize the value of protective orders issued\nin the family and criminal courts, and to prevent abusers from taking\nadvantage of legal proceedings to obtain otherwise sensitive\ninformation. This measure would prevent the government from unwitting\nfacilitation of a domestic violence victims' continued harassment or\nintimidation.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nFirst introduced in 2004.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
