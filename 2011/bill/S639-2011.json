GOLDEN, JOHNSON -- read twice and ordered printed,\n         and when printed to be committed to  the  Committee  on  Corporations,\n         Authorities and Commissions\n\n       AN ACT to amend the public authorities law, in relation to establishment\n         of a reverse mortgage loan program for low income seniors\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature  finds  and  declares\n    2  that  many  senior  citizens  living in New York own their own homes and\n    3  want to continue to live at home for as long  as  possible.  Nationally,\n    4  with over two trillion dollars tied up in home equity, reverse mortgages\n    5  have  the  potential  to dramatically increase the ability of seniors to\n    6  pay for their long-term care and remain  in  their  homes.  Today,  over\n    7  eighty  percent  of  older  Americans own their own homes, seventy-three\n    8  percent of which are owned free and clear of  any  mortgages.  Unlocking\n    9  these resources can help \"house-rich and cash-poor\" seniors purchase the\n   10  long-term  care  services they feel best meet their needs. Private funds\n   11  from reverse mortgages also  can  strengthen  community  long-term  care\n   12  systems  and  reduce the burden on state and local Medicaid budgets. The\n   13  purpose of this act is to establish  a  reverse  mortgage  loan  program\n   14  within the state of New York mortgage agency to enable low income elder-\n   15  ly homeowners to stay at home and pay for their long-term care.\n   16    S  2.  The  public  authorities law is amended by adding a new section\n   17  2405-f to read as follows:\n   18    S 2405-F. REVERSE MORTGAGE LOAN PROGRAM FOR LOW INCOME SENIORS.    (1)\n   19  AUTHORIZATION. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF LAW TO THE CONTRARY, THE\n   20  AGENCY IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED AND DIRECTED TO ESTABLISH A REVERSE MORTGAGE\n   21  LOAN PROGRAM FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENABLING LOW INCOME SENIOR HOMEOWNERS TO\n   22  USE THE EQUITY IN THEIR HOMES TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR LONG-TERM CARE NEEDS.\n   23  THE BANKING BOARD IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED TO VARY ANY RULES AND REGULATIONS\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD00191-01-1\n\n       S. 639                              2\n\n    1  PERTAINING  TO  REVERSE  MORTGAGE  LOANS TO ACCOMMODATE THE NEEDS OF THE\n    2  PROGRAM.\n    3    (2)  DEFINITIONS.
