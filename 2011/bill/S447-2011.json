However, if after the adjournment the board fixes a\n   45  new record date for the adjourned meeting, a  notice  of  the  adjourned\n   46  meeting  shall  be given to each shareholder of record on the new record\n   47  date entitled to notice under paragraph (a) of this section.\n   48    (C) NOTHING REQUIRED IN PARAGRAPHS (A) AND (B) OF THIS  SECTION  SHALL\n   49  LIMIT, RESTRICT OR SUPERSEDE OTHER FORMS OF VOTING AND PARTICIPATION.\n   50    S 3.
