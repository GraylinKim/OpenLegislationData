PHEFFER, MARKEY, DINOWITZ, GOTTFRIED, LANCMAN --\n         Multi-Sponsored by -- M. of A. BRENNAN, CLARK, COLTON,  COOK,  JACOBS,\n         MAYERSOHN,  MILLMAN, ROSENTHAL, TOWNS -- read once and referred to the\n         Committee on Economic Development, Job Creation, Commerce and Industry\n\n       AN ACT to amend the alcoholic  beverage  control  law,  in  relation  to\n         authorizing the creation of an alcoholic beverage control board in and\n         by the city of New York\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Declaration of legislative findings and intent. The  legis-\n    2  lature  hereby  finds,  determines  and  declares that it is a matter of\n    3  state concern and in the interest of the people of the state to  author-\n    4  ize  the  establishment of a city liquor authority in and by the city of\n    5  New York. The need for self-regulation of the sale of alcoholic beverag-\n    6  es by the city of New York is well documented. There are too many estab-\n    7  lishments in close proximity to each other that engage in  the  sale  of\n    8  alcoholic beverages. This has resulted in an increase in noise, traffic,\n    9  litter,  and criminal activities, especially late at night.  Consequent-\n   10  ly, the quality of life in neighborhoods within the city of New York has\n   11  deteriorated. Therefore, the legislature finds  and  declares  that  the\n   12  creation of a city liquor authority would enable the city of New York to\n   13  more  effectively  and  efficiently  monitor  these  establishments  and\n   14  enforce the alcoholic beverage  control  law.  The  legislature  further\n   15  finds  and  declares  that  the creation of a city liquor authority will\n   16  help improve the quality of life in the city of  New  York  as  well  as\n   17  insure compliance with other applicable laws.\n   18    It is the intent of the legislature to hereby authorize the establish-\n   19  ment  of a city liquor authority in and by the city of New York in order\n   20  to provide proper and adequate enforcement  of  the  alcoholic  beverage\n   21  control law.\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD00377-01-1\n\n       A. 1042                             2\n\n    1    S  2.
