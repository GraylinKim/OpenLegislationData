Legislative findings and intent. The legislature finds that\n    2  New  York  state's remanufacturing industry, which is composed of a wide\n    3  array of businesses, many of which are  small  businesses,  is  a  vital\n    4  sector  of  the  economy,  employing thousands of people while diverting\n    5  thousands of tons of waste from entering our  landfills.  Remanufactured\n    6  products  are  the  highest form of recycling, and are supplied from our\n    7  largest growth sector, small businesses. Based  on  these  findings  the\n    8  legislature  finds  and  declares that the state should actively seek to\n    9  enhance the remanufacturing industry and increase awareness of the bene-\n   10  fits of remanufactured products.\n   11    S 2. A temporary state commission, to be known as the temporary  state\n   12  commission  on  remanufacturing,  hereinafter referred to as the commis-\n   13  sion, is hereby  created  to  develop  programs  and  policies  for  the\n   14  purposes  of  enhancing  and  fostering the introduction, expansion, and\n   15  growth of the remanufacturing industry in New York state, and remanufac-\n   16  turing efforts among state agencies.\n   17    S 3.
