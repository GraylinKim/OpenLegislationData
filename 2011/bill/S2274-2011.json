  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2274\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nauthorizing medication and treatment compliance demonstration\nprograms and providing for the repeal of such\nprograms upon the expiration\nthereof\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nAuthorizes the Department of Health to design demonstration programs\nto improve medication and treatment compliance. Services to be\nprovided and chronic health problems to be addressed are described.\nDOH is made responsible for regulating the quality, appropriateness\nand the cost effectiveness of the demonstration programs, and is\nauthorized to utilize all potential sources of funding.\n\nEnrollment in programs is made voluntary, and participating\nindividuals are allowed to discontinue at any time without cause.\n\nThe Commissioner of Health is authorized to review and approve all\nenrollment and marketing materials for demonstration programs, and\nis directed to provide an interim report on or before December 31,\n2012 and a final report on or before December 31, 2014.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nUnnecessary medical costs associated with non-compliant behavior of\npatients have reached staggering proportions in today's health care\nenvironment. Health care professionals have been continually\nfrustrated with the inability of many patients to follow through with\nthe medication or treatment regimen that has been prescribed. The\nexpanded use of home care has brought with it new and ever growing\ncomplexities regarding compliance.\n\nNon-compliant behavior has resulted in the expenditure of billions of\nhealth care dollar's for preventable hospital and nursing home\nadmissions, physician visits, tests, and prescriptions. It has been\nestimated that up to one third of the hospital and one half of the\nnursing home admissions among elderly patients can be attributed to\npatients not taking their medication as directed.\n\nThese demonstration programs will target approximately 1-2 percent of\nthe general population or 4-8 percent of the elderly population who\nare using 5060 percent of all health care dollars. With concerns over\ncontrolling health care costs, and the advent of managed care,\ncapitation agreements and other risk sharing arrangements, the need\nto control needless over utilization has never been more evident.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nThe Health Commissioner is authorized to utilize all potential Sources\nof funding. The demonstration is made eligible for Medicaid\n\nreimbursement as long as federal financial participation is\navailable. It is\nestimated that a $4,200 annual expenditure per person for the\nmonitoring program can save $46,200 by keeping a patient out of a\nnursing home.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately and expires on March 31, 2017.\n\n",
