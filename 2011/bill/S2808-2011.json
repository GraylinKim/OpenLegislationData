Such request shall be made to the commissioner in  such  form  as\n    6  the  commissioner  shall  prescribe, and shall be based on documentation\n    7  that the total amount to be recovered is in excess of one percent of the\n    8  district's total general fund  expenditures  for  the  preceding  school\n    9  year.  The  amount to be deducted in the first year shall be the greater\n   10  of (i) the sum of the amount of such excess payments that is  recognized\n   11  as  a liability due to other governments by the district for the preced-\n   12  ing school year and the positive remainder of the district's  unreserved\n   13  fund  balance at the close of the preceding school year less the product\n   14  of the district's total general  fund  expenditures  for  the  preceding\n   15  school year multiplied by five percent, or (ii) one-third of such excess\n   16  payments.
