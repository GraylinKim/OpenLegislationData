  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2517\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public service law, in relation to requiring at least one\ncommissioner of the public service commission to have experience in\nutility consumer advocacy\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nBy requiring that at least one member of the Public Service Commission\nmust be an experienced consumer advocate, this bill will help restore\nthe effectiveness of that body in ensuring that public utilities\noperate in the best interest of the public.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nBill &sect;1 amends subdivision 1 of &sect;4 of the Public Service to add a\nrequirement that at least one commissioner of the Public Service\nCommission (PSC) must have experience in utility consumer advocacy.\n\nEFFECTS OF PRESENT LAW WHICH THIS BILL WOULD ALTER:\nOther than provisions for political party balance, there are currently\nno statutory standards for appointments to the PSC. This stands in\nmarked contrast to statutes in many other states, which provide\nvarious mechanisms for determining qualifications for utility\nregulators -- including requirements in two of our neighboring states\nthat at least one commissioner must have experience in consumer\nprotection and advocacy.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe Public Service Commission is responsible for overseeing the\noperations of \"public utilities\" -- providers of energy,\ntelecommunications and cable services that provide essential services\nthrough the use of public rights-of-way and similar common resources.\nIt has long been recognized that, as was stated by then-Governor\nFranklin Roosevelt in 1932, the PSC is not a \"mere arbitrator\" but\nacts \"as agent of the public\" in seeing that utilities \"do two\nthings: first, give people adequate service; second, charge\nreasonable rates....\"\n\nIn recent years, many people believe that the PSC has strayed from its\ncore mission of ensuring consumers receive adequate service at\nreasonable rates. To rectify this situation, this legislation would\nrequire that at least one PSC commissioner must have experience in\nadvocating for the interests of utility consumers. This provision is\nalready in force in the State of Connecticut (C.G.S. 516-2). Another\nof our neighbors, Massachusetts, similarly requires that one of its\ncommissioners must have a background and experience in consumer\nprotection and advocacy issues (Mass. Gen. Laws title 25, 52).\n\nPlacing a dedicated consumer representative on the PSC will help\nensure that the interests of working families, small businesses and\nother rate payers are not subordinated to the interests of public\n\nutilities and other commercial interests that are already\nwell-represented in PSC proceedings.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nNew bill.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThirtieth day after becoming law, and will apply to any appointments\nto the PSC made on or after such date.\n\n",
