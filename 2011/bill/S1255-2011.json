  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1255\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the environmental\nconservation law, in relation to making\nmonk (Quaker) parakeets\nprotected birds\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nThis bill would protect Monk (Quaker) parakeets, enabling nest sites\nto not be disturbed intentionally without permit should the nest site\nbe a matter of imminent threat to public safety.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nAn amendment is made-to paragraph A of subdivision 5 of section\n11-0103 of the Environmental conservation Law, as amended by chapter\n47 of the laws of 1976, to read that Monk (Quaker) parakeets are to\nbe protected in New York state.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nCurrently, wild Quaker parakeets (a/k/a Monk Parakeets, species\nMyiopsitta monachus), are unprotected in New York state. As these\nhighly intelligent birds have resided in the New York city area for\nsome forty years, it is requested that they be placed in \"protected\"\nstatus by amending the New York state Environmental Conservation\nLaws. protected status allows for the removal of nest sites through\nthe issuance of permits.\n\nQuaker parakeets are not harmful to the environment, have not\ndisplaced and been a threat to any native species, and have not been\nproven to cause damage to any public utilities. Although they are\nconsidered pests by some because of the nature of their nest\nbuilding, they are often trapped and euthanized as pests by\nexterminators.\n\nIn addition, since some of these wild birds may have been adopted as\npets and are thus domesticated, they shall be excluded as an illegal\nspecies within their household.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-2010: S.4131 - Referred to Environmental Conservation\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nShall take effect immediately.\n\n",
