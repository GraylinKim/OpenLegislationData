JOHNSON, GRISANTI, SEWARD -- read twice and ordered\n         printed, and  when  printed  to  be  committed  to  the  Committee  on\n         Commerce, Economic Development and Small Business\n\n       AN  ACT  to  amend the economic development law, in relation to creating\n         the Empire State baseball trails program\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section  1.  The  economic  development law is amended by adding a new\n    2  article 5-F to read as follows:\n    3                                 ARTICLE 5-F\n    4                    EMPIRE STATE BASEBALL TRAILS PROGRAM\n    5  SECTION 181-F. LEGISLATIVE INTENT.\n    6          181-G. DEFINITIONS.\n    7          181-H. GENERAL FUNCTIONS, POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE COMMISSIONER.\n    8    S 181-F. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZES  THAT  PROFES-\n    9  SIONAL BASEBALL HAS HISTORICALLY PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE ECONOM-\n   10  IC AND CULTURAL LIFE OF THE STATE. THE PUBLIC IS GENERALLY FAMILIAR WITH\n   11  THE  TWO  MAJOR LEAGUE TEAMS IN NEW YORK CITY, AS WELL AS WITH THE BASE-\n   12  BALL HALL OF FAME IN COOPERSTOWN. THERE IS MUCH  LESS  PUBLIC  AWARENESS\n   13  THAT  NEW  YORK  STATE  IS  ALSO THE HOME OF THIRTEEN PROFESSIONAL MINOR\n   14  LEAGUE AND INDEPENDENT LEAGUE TEAMS SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE STATE.  GREAT-\n   15  ER PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THESE TEAMS AND  THEIR  GAME  SCHEDULES  HAS  THE\n   16  POTENTIAL  TO  SIGNIFICANTLY ADD TO THE STATE'S TOURISM TRADE. THE MINOR\n   17  LEAGUE AND INDEPENDENT LEAGUE TEAMS ARE SMALL BUSINESSES THEMSELVES, AND\n   18  COULD HELP TO DRAW IN-STATE AND OUT-OF-STATE TOURISTS TO  THEIR  RESPEC-\n   19  TIVE  AREAS  OF NEW YORK, THEREBY INCREASING HOTEL, RESTAURANT AND OTHER\n   20  TOURIST RELATED SMALL BUSINESSES. IT IS, THEREFORE, THE INTENT  OF  THIS\n   21  LEGISLATURE  TO HAVE CREATED A PROGRAM WHICH WILL SYSTEMATICALLY PROMOTE\n   22  NEW YORK MINOR LEAGUE AND  INDEPENDENT  LEAGUE  BASEBALL  AS  A  TOURIST\n   23  ATTRACTION,  BY ESTABLISHING A BASEBALL TRAIL PROGRAM. IT IS THE FURTHER\n   24  INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT THESE TRAILS BE LINKED THEMATICALLY,  AND\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD07165-01-1\n\n       S. 2520                             2\n\n    1  BE  CONSTRUED SO AS TO BE EASILY TRAVELED BY TOURISTS AND BASEBALL FANS.\n    2  THE LEGISLATURE SEEKS THE CREATION OF ITINERARIES TO AID TRAVELERS ALONG\n    3  BASEBALL TRAILS, WHICH ALSO LINK TOGETHER OTHER ATTRACTIONS  AND  VENUES\n    4  ALONG  SAID  TRAILS IN ORDER TO ATTRACT VISITORS WITH A SIMPLE AND EFFI-\n    5  CIENT TRAVEL PLAN. FURTHER IT IS THE INTENT OF THIS LEGISLATURE  TO  SEE\n    6  THAT  THESE TRAILS ARE ADEQUATELY SIGNED SO THAT TRAVELERS MAY INDEPEND-\n    7  ENTLY FOLLOW THE TRAIL WITH EASE.\n    8    S 181-G.
