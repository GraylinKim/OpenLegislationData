  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2468\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the state finance law and the agriculture and markets law, in\nrelation to enacting the \"buy from the backyard act\"\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nTo require that State agencies who purchase food and food products to\npurchase 20% of their total contracts for food from within New York\nState, likely resulting in significant spending in New York State's\nagricultural industry.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1. Designates this act to be known as the \"Buy From the\nBackyard Act\".\n\nSection 2. Amends &sect;165(4) of the State Finance Law to require that\nduring each fiscal year, not less than twenty percent of food\nproducts purchased through contracts on behalf of facilities and\ninstitutions of the State, be products grown, produced or harvested\nin New York State, or that any processing of such food products took\nplace within New York State. This section also classifies\n\"competitive purchasing\" under the subdivision to be deemed to be\nestablished when the cost of such products are not more than ten\npercent higher than other food products.\n\nSection 3. Adds a Section 5-a to the Agriculture and Markets Law to\nrequire a yearly report, on or before March 1st of each year, by the\nCommissioner of Agriculture and Markets, to the Governor and\nLegislature regarding the compliance by State agencies with &sect; 165(4)\nof State Finance Law.\n\nSection 4. Sets the effective date as the first of April next\nsucceeding the date on which it shall have become a law.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThis bill expands upon an existing law, which creates a program that\nencourages the purchase of local food products by State agencies.\nThese inevitable purchases by the State agencies will provide a boost\nto the\neconomy within the boundaries of the New York State. This bill would\nrequire that 20 percent of the total contracts for food by a\nState agency during each fiscal year be bought \"from the backyard\".\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010: S.6974 - Referred to Finance\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nThis legislation is likely to result in significant spending in local\nagricultural industries, which employ many local workers. As one of\nthe top industries in the State, agriculture is a vital part of our\nefforts to create new jobs. There may be a slight cost to the State\ndue to the competitive pricing flexibility allowed in the bill.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nFirst of April next succeeding the date on which it shall have become\na law.\n\n",
