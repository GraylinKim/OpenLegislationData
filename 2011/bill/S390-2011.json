Legislative findings. The legislature finds that there are\n    2  in the city of New York many large capital projects to  be  financed  in\n    3  whole  or  in part with public funds or to be supported by tax and other\n    4  public incentives and which are crucial to  the  economic  and  cultural\n    5  interests  of  such city and the state of New York as a whole, and which\n    6  are at some stage of proposal, planning or implementation. The  legisla-\n    7  ture  further  finds that it is important that a full disclosure be made\n    8  of the details of such projects, their projected costs to the  city  and\n    9  state  and  to  public benefit corporations, the projected benefits, the\n   10  reasons why some of them have been delayed and why some of the proposals\n   11  have been modified. Accordingly, it is critical that the New York  state\n   12  urban  development  corporation, also known as the Empire State Develop-\n   13  ment Corporation, provide a prompt report to  the  legislature  on  such\n   14  projects  so  the  legislature may provide the necessary policy determi-\n   15  nations and establish appropriate priorities so that necessary  projects\n   16  can proceed.\n   17    S 2.

The term \"projects\"  shall  mean  all  development,  redevelopment,\n   24  construction,  repair, and refurbishment projects within the city of New\n   25  York in which the corporation or any  subsidiary  or  affiliate  of  the\n   26  corporation  is involved with the planning, financing, or contracting in\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD00855-01-1\n\n       S. 390                              2\n\n    1  whole or in part and any project related to such  projects,  whether  or\n    2  not  the  corporation  or  its  subsidiary or affiliate is involved.
