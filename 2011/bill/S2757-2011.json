  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2757\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the multiple dwelling law, in relation to rent reduction in\ncases of submetered utility service\n\nPURPOSE:\nThe bill would require a rent reduction\nequal to the amount\nof the additional charge for the utilities for tenants in buildings\nwhich convert to submetering of utilities.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThe bill proposes adding a section 302-d to the\nmultiple dwelling law which would, in apartment buildings which\nconvert to submetering, require a rent reduction equal to the\nadditional utility cost, and compel the Department of Housing and\nCommunity Renewal to promulgate an appeals' process by which tenants\ncan challenge the amount of the reduction and have it adjusted. Also,\nwithin ninety days of the enactment of this legislation, the DHCR\nmust review the rent reductions which have already been made in\nsubmetered buildings in order to ensure that they are equal to the\namount of the utility charges.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nMany residential apartment buildings in New York\ninclude charges for utilities in the rent. However an increasing\nnumber of landlords are installing \"submeters\" which monitor utility\nuse individually for each unit in the building. After the submeters\nare installed, the landlords charge tenants for utilities in addition\nto the rent. Under current law, the additional utility charges are\naccompanied by a rent reduction set by the Division of Housing and\nCommunity Renewal. These rent reductions, however, are based on the\nnumber of rooms in an apartment and do not reflect the actual utility\nusage costs of the tenants. This leads to many tenants having to pay\nmore than they had agreed to pay when they signed their lease in\norder to stay in their apartments after their building converts to\nsubmetering.\n\nThis bill mandates that the rent reductions which tenants receive\nafter their building is converted must be based on their actual\nutility costs in order to protect against an increase in the cost of\nliving for tenants. This legislation would also require the DHCR to,\nwithin 90 days, review the rent reductions which have already been\nmade, and to modify them, if necessary, in order to bring them in\nline with tenants' actual costs. The bill would also require the DHCR\nto create an appeals process by which tenants can challenge their\nrent reductions.\n\nCurrently rent reductions are based on the New York City Housing\nVacancy Survey's average monthly costs for utilities. In the Survey,\n\ntenants were asked to \"estimate\" their monthly utility costs. This\nproduced highly questionable data, upon which the DHCR's rent\nreductions were based.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-2010: Senate & Assembly Referred to Housing, Construction\n& Community Development\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
