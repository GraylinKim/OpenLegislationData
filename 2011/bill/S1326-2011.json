  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1326\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn  act  to  amend  the social services law, in relation to establishing\nfactors to be considered when a health care practitioner  upon  examina-\ntion  has  a  different opinion from an applicant's treating health care\npractitioner's opinion as to an applicant's disability; and requiring an\nexplicit written determination by the health care practitioner when  the\ndiagnoses differ\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo  ensure  that  the opinions and determinations of a public assistance\napplicant's treating  health  care  practitioner  are  given  sufficient\nweight when making disability determinations.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection  1  amends  section  332-b  of the social services law, by which\nprovides that if a public assistance applicant is sent to a practitioner\nto determine if the applicant has any work limitations, the practitioner\nmust take into account the applicant's treating health care  practition-\ner's  opinion,  and  give  it  sufficient  weight  based  on a number of\nfactors.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nCurrently it is within the evaluating practitioner's discretion what, if\nany, weight is given to the treating health care practitioner's opinion.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIf an individual applying for public assistance  has  work  limitations,\ndisabilities,  or  health  issues  which  have  been identified by their\ntreating health care practitioner, their diagnosis  and  recommendations\nshould be considered to be accurate, in the absence of any contradictory\nfindings. As the current law is written, there is little weight given to\nthe  treating health care practitioner's opinion, and if not supplied in\na very timely fashion, is not even considered in making a  determination\non work limitations.\n\nThe  social  services  appointed  examining  practitioner  only sees the\napplicant for one short assessment, which is not  always  sufficient  in\nexploring  many  complicated  issues related to work limitations. If the\napplicant's treating health care practitioner has been following him  or\nher  for a long period of time, they most likely have established enough\nof a relationship with their patient which would allow for the discovery\nof hidden disabilities that the examiner may never find.\n\nThe federal government recognizes the importance  of  giving  sufficient\nconsideration  to  a  physician's  medical opinion, and they follow this\npractice explicitly in their Supplemental Security Income  determination\nprocedure,  detailed  in  20  CFR 416.927. This section of federal regu-\nlation outlines Evaluating Opinion Evidence, and it is after this feder-\nal regulation that this bill has been modeled after.\n\nIt is for this reason that if the examiner makes any  findings  contrary\nto  the  treating  health care practitioner's diagnosis, the reasons for\nthe differing diagnosis should have to be defended and explicitly stated\nin writing.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009/10 - S.5547/A.1417A\n2007/08 - S.1509/A.7946\n2005/06 - S.1745/A.5402\n2003/04 - S.624/A.9983\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n90 Days.\n\n",
