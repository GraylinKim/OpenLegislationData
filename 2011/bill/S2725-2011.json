  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2725\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to the crime of persistent\ncriminal contempt\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThe penal law is amended by adding a new section 60.15 which\nestablishes sentencing upon the conviction of persistent criminal\ncontempt. The relevant provisions of section 60.27 of this article\nrelating to restitution and reparation, and the relevant provisions\nof section 60.35 of this article relating to the imposition of a\nmandatory surcharge, crime victims assistance fee and other\napplicable fees or surcharges, shall also apply to any sentence\nimposed pursuant to this section. The penal law is amended by adding\na new section 215.47 Persistent criminal contempt.\n\nPURPOSE OF BILL:\nPersistent criminal contempt is defined as violating a duly served\norder of protection, or such order of which the defendant has actual\nknowledge because he or she was present in court when such order was\nissued. This applies to family court or an order of protection issued\nby a court of competent jurisdiction in another state, territory or\ntribal jurisdiction. Applies when the defendant was previously\nconvicted of the crime of aggravated criminal contempt for violating\na duly served order of protection of which the defendant had\nknowledge or has previously been found to have willfully or\nintentionally violated an order of protection or temporary order of\nprotection in accordance with the provisions of judiciary, domestic\nrelations or family court law.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThis legislation is prompted by a Queens incident in which the\nviolator of a non-domestic violence case brutally mutilated a woman\nwho had 9 (nine) orders of protection (OP) against him. New York must\ndo something to address the issue of continuous violations of orders\nof protection for both domestic violence and non-domestic violence\ncases. Present law does not sufficiently address the issue of repeat\nOP offenders for both domestic violence and non-domestic violence\ncases.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nThis bill was previously introduced. Passed Senate 6/15/2010.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n None to the state.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nFirst day of November next succeeding the date on\nwhich it shall have become a law.\n\n",
