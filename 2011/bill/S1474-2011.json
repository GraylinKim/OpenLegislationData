  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1474\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the education law, in relation to exempting tuition payments\nfrom items\nused to determine total spending under a contingency school budget\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo exempt tuition payments from the types of expenditures used to\ndetermine total spending under a contingency school budget.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThis legislation would amend paragraph b of\nsubdivision 4 of section 2023 of the education law by adding a new\nsubparagraph (ix) thereto which exempts tuition payments made by\nschool districts from the list of expenditures used in determining\ntotal spending under a contingency school budget.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nUnder existing law, tuition payments made by school\ndistricts are expenditures that are included in the calculation to\ndetermine total spending under a contingency school budget.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nWhen a school district's budget proposals are not\napproved by the voters the sole trustee, board of trustees, or board\nof education must adopt a contingency budget. The contingency budget,\nby law, is not permitted to exceed 4% increase in total spending over\nthe district's total spending under the school district budget for\nthe prior school year.\n\nThe school district does not determine the payments made to another\nschool district for tuition and therefore these payments could far\nexceed the 4% increase from the previous year's spending for which a\nschool district is permitted to levy a tax for a contingency budget.\nThe school district could conceivably find itself paying such sum to\nanother school district that it would be left without any increase in\nmonies to pay for necessary expenses. This legislation would exempt\ntuition payments, which a school district has no control in\ndetermining, from its contingency budget.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2001-02: S.3288/A.6610\n2003-04: S.331/A.1804\n2005-06: S.542/A.882\n2007-08: S.132/A.173\n2009-10: S.242/A.332\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
