  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1452\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public authorities law, in relation to authorizing a no\nfare program for transportation on the Long Island Rail Road for police\nofficers employed by the towns of Suffolk\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo include police officers employed by the towns in Suffolk County in\nthe provisions governing the Long Island Rail Road's Free Police Ride\nProgram.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSubdivision 14 of Section 1266 of the public authorities law is\namended to include police officers employed by the towns in Suffolk\nCounty in the Long Island Rail Road's Free Police Ride Program\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nFor the increased protection and improved safety of commuters and\nemployees, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) currently\nadministers a program that provides free transportation on the Long\nIsland Rail Road (LIRR) for certain police officers. Police officers\nemployed the City of New York, the County of Nassau, Nassau County\nvillages and cities, County of Suffolk, Suffolk County towns and\nvillages, the Division of State Police, the Port Authority of New\nYork and New Jersey, the Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company, the\nNew York City Housing Authority and the New York City Transit\nAuthority have been actively participating in this no fare program\nover the past several years.\n\nA recent audit conducted by the MTA, however, revealed an apparent\noversight in the provisions of law governing the LIRR's Free Police\nProgram, &sect; 1266 (14) of the Public Authorities Law.\nThose police officers employed by the towns within Suffolk County are\nnot included in statute.\nAs a result, the MTA can no longer allow these police officers to\nparticipate in the LIRR Free Police Ride Program as of January 1, 2011.\n\nWhile the reason for this omission is unclear, the LIRR has indicated\nits support for amending the statute to add police officers employed\nby the towns in Suffolk County. This legislation merely corrects this\noversight to grant the MTA the legal authority to extend this\nprogram to these officers.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-10: S.6764\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
