  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1348\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the vehicle and traffic law and the penal law, in relation to\ndistribution of certain mandatory surcharges imposed for alcohol-related\ntraffic convictions\n\nPURPOSE OF THE BILL:\nTo provide for the necessary direction and\nadequate funding for the successful implementation of the ignition\ninterlock provisions of Chapter 496 of the Laws of 2009 (\"Leandra's\nLaw\").\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\n(1) Amends subdivision 1 of &sect;1197 and\nsubdivision 9 of 1803 of the vehicle and Traffic Law (VTL) to direct\nfines imposed for the traffic offenses of \"driving outside the terms\nof a conditional license\" and \"circumventing a required ignition\ninterlock device\" to the STOP-DWI Program in the county of the\nviolation -- making these offenses consistent with all other\nalcohol-related provisions of the VTL.\n\n(2) Amends subdivision 5 of VTL &sect;1197 to add \"implementation of the\nignition interlock program as set forth in VTL &sect;1198\" to the\nfunctions and funding responsibilities of the County STOP-DWI\ncoordinator.\n\n(3) Amends VTL &sect;&sect; 1809-c and 1809-e to direct that mandatory\nsurcharges be imposed for the traffic offenses of \"driving outside\nthe terms of a conditional license\" and \"circumventing a required\nignition interlock device\" making these offenses consistent with all\nother alcohol-related provisions of the VTL.\n\n(4) Amends VTL &sect;&sect; 1809-C and 1809-e to direct that mandatory\nsurcharges imposed and collected under both of these provisions be\ndirected to the STOP-DWI Program in the county where the offense\noccurred.\n\n(5) Amends subdivision 3 of &sect;60.35 of the penal Law to conform the\nfine and surcharge collection process consistent with the intent of\nthis bill.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nChapter 496 of the Laws of 2009, also known as\nLeandra's Law, requires inter alia that the sentence for all persons\nconvicted of driving while intoxicated include a period of probation\nor conditional discharge, a condition of which shall include the\ninstallation of an ignition interlock device on all vehicles owned or\noperated by such person, for the period of probation (at least 3\n\nyears) or conditional discharge, but not less than six months. This\nprovision takes effect on August 15, 2010.\n\nAs a result of this law, 25,000 people annually will be sentenced\npursuant to this requirement. In seeking to implement this law, the\nDivision of\nProbation and Correctional Alternatives has promulgated an emergency\nrule that essentially orders the counties to develop a program to\nimplement the massive and recurring requirements associated with\ncompliance, tracking and monitoring those subject to conditional\ndischarge. However, it provides no funding for either these tasks,\nnor for the 12,000+ new probationers likely to exist as a result of\nthis statute. Actually, it would appear that the 2012-2011 Budget\nwill, instead, reduce state funding for Probation services by another\n10% this year.\n\nThus, the counties are currently faced with a combination of a\nseriously unfunded mandate and the requirement that they develop an\nentirely new program pursuant to the new rule.\n\nThis measure resolves both of these problems as well as a third. Over\nthe years, the State has added a series of mandatory surcharges to\nalcohol related offenses strictly for budget relief, in total\nignorance of sound criminal justice policy and to the immediate\nfinancial detriment of the county STOP-DWI Programs that rely\nexclusively upon the fines imposed for alcohol-related offenses.\n\nThis bill would address all three issues. First, it utilizes the\ncounty STOP-DWI program and its existing statutory funding mechanism\nto fully realize the ignition interlock program rather than force\ncounties to develop an entirely new -- and unfunded -- process.\nSecond, it establishes a recurring revenue stream to provide the\ncounties with the necessary funding to implement the expansive new\nignition interlock program and maintain it going forward. It does so\nby redirecting the surcharges collected under VTL sections\n1809-c($25) and 1809-e($170) from the General Fund to the local\nSTOP-DWI Program. Third, it helps reinforce the local option STOP-DWI\nPrograms that collectively have made New York a national model for\naddressing the challenges presented by the drunk driver, but have\nrecently seen their revenue streams reduced out of expediency for\nquick-fix State budget relief.\n\nIn order for this program to work, there must be confidence in the\nability for counties to implement and maintain it. The unintended\nconsequences of this act can surely undermine the Legislature's\nintent and leave the program in shambles. At least 25 counties have\nalready asked for a two-year moratorium on the new law until a\nfunding stream has been established.\nFurthermore, it is obvious that the mischief that can arise from the\nsuddenly overwhelmed local courts could result in thousands of new\noffenders sent to an already overburdened probation system or,\nthousands of persons who should be convicted of DWI, being allowed to\n\nplead to the traffic offense of DWAI -both for the purposes of\nexpediency, and neither consistent with the intent New York's\ncommitment to eradicate drunk driving. This bill presents an\nopportunity to have the new law implemented in a manner that reflects\nthe Legislature's intent when it was enacted.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010:  S.7951/A.11374A - Passed Senate 2010\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nApproximately $6.8 million in mandatory\nsurcharges will be redirected from the General Fund to the counties\nbased upon the county of conviction.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately, provided,\nhowever, the provisions of section one, three, four and five shall\ntake effect on the sixtieth day after it shall have become a law, and\nprovided further, however, that section six shall take effect on the\nfirst day of April, 2011.\n\n",
