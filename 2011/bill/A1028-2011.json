PHEFFER,  MILLMAN, COLTON, P. RIVERA, GALEF,\n         JAFFEE, CAHILL, ROBINSON, ROSENTHAL, CLARK, HOOPER --  Multi-Sponsored\n         by  --  M.  of A. BOYLAND, GLICK, HOYT, LANCMAN, MAGEE, MAISEL, MAYER-\n         SOHN, McENENY, PERRY, REILLY, J. RIVERA, SCARBOROUGH, SWEENEY,  TOWNS,\n         WEISENBERG  --  read  once  and  referred to the Committee on Consumer\n         Affairs and Protection\n\n       AN ACT to amend the general business law and the civil practice law  and\n         rules, in relation to debt collection agencies\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Legislative intent. The legislature hereby finds the  pres-\n    2  ence  of consumer-related problems with respect to the practices of debt\n    3  collection agencies. Federal and state laws regulate how debt collectors\n    4  may communicate with debtors and prohibit the use of  certain  threaten-\n    5  ing,  deceptive  and  unfair  collection  practices. Despite these legal\n    6  protections, the number of consumer complaints regarding debt collection\n    7  practices continue to rise. Consumer complaints received by the  Federal\n    8  Trade  Commission  regarding  third-party  debt  collectors grew for the\n    9  eleventh consecutive year in 2008, and consumers filed with the  Commis-\n   10  sion  more  complaints  against  third-party collectors than against any\n   11  other specific industry. While the majority  of  those  engaged  in  the\n   12  business  of  debt  collection are honest and ethical in their dealings,\n   13  there is a minority of unscrupulous  collection  agencies  in  operation\n   14  that practice abusive tactics. Due to the sensitive nature of the infor-\n   15  mation  used  in  the course of such agency's everyday business, and the\n   16  vulnerable position consumers find themselves in when dealing with these\n   17  agencies, it is incumbent upon this legislature to  protect  the  inter-\n   18  ests,  reputations  and  fiscal well-being of the citizens of this state\n   19  against those agencies who would abuse  their  privilege  of  operation.\n   20  Therefore,  it  is  herein  declared  that the state should license debt\n   21  collection agencies.\n   22    S 2. The general business law is  amended  by  adding  a  new  article\n   23  29-HHH to read as follows:\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD00800-01-1\n\n       A. 1028                             2\n\n    1                               ARTICLE 29-HHH\n    2                          DEBT COLLECTION AGENCIES\n    3  SECTION 604-K.
