  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2002\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the executive law, in relation to including the conviction of\nany offense which requires the taking of fingerprints upon arrest,\nwithin the definition of \"designated offender\" for purposes of the state\nDNA identification index\n\nPURPOSE:\nExpands the list of criminal convictions which require a\nperson to give a DNA sample for inclusion in the state DNA database.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 of the bill expands the definition of \"designated offender\"\nas used in provisions establishing the DNA database. This amendment\nexpands the list of convictions which require the defendant to give a\nDNA sample to now include a conviction for any offense for which a\nfingerprint is required to be taken pursuant to subdivision one of\nsection 160.10 of the Criminal Procedure Law.\n\nSection 2 of the bill provides that these provisions shall be\neffective immediately and shall apply to designated offenses\ncommitted on and after the effective date as well as to designated\noffenses committed prior to the effective date where service of the\nsentence imposed upon the conviction is not completed prior to the\neffective date.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nExisting law now provides a list of crimes for which a\nperson is required to give a DNA sample to the database. However, not\nall offenses for which a fingerprint is required to be taken are\nincluded in this list. Increasing the list of crimes for which DNA\nsamples are required will enhance the possibilities of both detecting\nthe perpetrators of crimes which have already been committed and\npreventing the commission of crimes in the future.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThere are approximately 130,000 Penal Law misdemeanor and felony\nconvictions annually in New York State. Experience has clearly shown\nthat many perpetrators convicted of lower or mid-level crimes have\ncommitted, or will subsequently commit, more serious and violent\ncrimes. It is now well recognized that the State DNA Databank has\nallowed law enforcement officers to link crimes in different\njurisdictions, identify suspects, and, equally important, exonerate\nthe innocent.\n\nIn 2006 the Databank was expanded to include all felonies defined in\nthe penal law as well as seventeen misdemeanors. There are over\n200,000 recorded misdemeanor convictions in the state each year.\nWhile all of these persons convicted of misdemeanors are required to\nprovide a fingerprint, many of these same persons are not required to\n\nsubmit a DNA sample. Experience has shown that many serious felony\noffenders have a long prior history of petty crimes. Including all\noffenses which must be fingerprinted in the DNA database will allow\nearlier detection of these criminal individuals, prevent the\ncommission of future crimes and provide a broader database for\npersons to access for the purpose of establishing their innocence.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009/2010 - S.3111 Referred to Codes\n2007 - S.2375 - Controversial - Passed Senate 54-6/Senator Sabini asked\na question, 166 3/21\n2008 - S.2375 - Controversial - Passed Senate 51-9/Senator Schneiderman\nexplained his vote\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nThe costs associated with expansion of the\ndatabase provided for in this bill have been funded in the 2006-2007\nstate budget. The 2006-07 budget provided significant funding not\nonly for the expansion enacted in 2006, but also to process samples\nwell in excess of the samples that are to be submitted under the\nexisting law as modified by the expansion enacted in 2006.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately and applicable to designated offenses\ncommitted on and after the effective date as well as to designated\noffenses committed prior to the effective date where service of the\nsentence upon such offense has not been completed prior to the\neffective date.\n\n",
