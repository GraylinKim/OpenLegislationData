THIS ARTICLE SHALL BE KNOWN AND MAY BE CITED AS\n   15  THE \"NEW YORK STATE HEAD INJURY AWARENESS AND PREVENTION ACT\".\n   16    S 3051. LEGISLATIVE INTENT.  1. IT IS AND HAS BEEN  THE  LONG-STANDING\n   17  POLICY  OF  THE STATE OF NEW YORK THAT THE WELL-BEING OF OUR CHILDREN IS\n   18  PARAMOUNT. THE STATE ALSO HAS A PROUD HISTORY OF PROMOTING THE  DEVELOP-\n   19  MENT  OF  HEALTHY  MINDS  AND  BODIES  IN OUR CHILDREN BY INVOLVEMENT IN\n   20  SPORTS, WHICH STATE POLICY HAS SUPPORTED AT ALL LEVELS OF OUR  EDUCATION\n   21  AND  HIGHER  EDUCATION SYSTEMS.   REPORTED MILD TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES\n   22  (TBIS), COMMONLY KNOWN AS CONCUSSIONS, OCCUR AT  ALL  LEVELS  OF  SPORTS\n   23  PLAY.  THE  NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH REPORTS THAT BETWEEN THE\n   24  YEARS TWO THOUSAND SIX AND TWO THOUSAND  EIGHT  MORE  THAN  TWENTY-THREE\n   25  THOUSAND  SCHOOL  AGED  YOUTH  VISITED  THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OR WERE\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD00794-01-1\n\n       A. 2140                             2\n\n    1  HOSPITALIZED FOR CONCUSSIONS ANNUALLY WITH THE  COST  OF  THEIR  MEDICAL\n    2  CARE  APPROACHING  EIGHTY  MILLION DOLLARS. THE THREE YEAR TOTAL COST OF\n    3  BOTH HOSPITALIZATION AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS IN THE SAME  PERIOD\n    4  FOR ALL AGE GROUPS IN THE STATE FOR TREATMENT OF TBIS WAS OVER A BILLION\n    5  DOLLARS.\n    6    2.  THE  LEGISLATURE  FURTHER FINDS THAT EARLY INTERVENTION, RESPONSE,\n    7  AND THE PROPER EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF CONCUSSIONS WILL LESSEN  THE\n    8  EFFECTS OF THIS POTENTIALLY LIFE THREATENING INJURY.  IT IS ESSENTIAL TO\n    9  EDUCATE PARENTS AND GUARDIANS, STUDENTS, COACHES AND SCHOOL PERSONNEL ON\n   10  THE  EARLY AND ACCURATE RECOGNITION OF THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF CONCUS-\n   11  SIONS AND THE POTENTIAL HARMFUL EFFECTS OF HEAD INJURIES NOT JUST  ON  A\n   12  CHILD'S  PHYSICAL  WELL-BEING  BUT ON HIS OR HER ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AS\n   13  WELL.\n   14    3.
