This act shall be known and may be cited as\n    9  the \"Small Business Utility Boards Act\".\n   10    S 2. Legislative intent. The legislature hereby declares that adequate\n   11  and affordable utility service to  small  businesses  in  the  state  is\n   12  necessary  to  guarantee  stability  and foster growth in this important\n   13  sector of our economy. Small businesses are responsible for the creation\n   14  of most of the new employment opportunities in  this  state,  and  their\n   15  continued existence and productivity is in the interest of the state and\n   16  its  citizens.  It  is  the policy of this state to foster and encourage\n   17  active participation by small  businesses  in  utility  matters  and  to\n   18  facilitate  effective  representation  and  advocacy  of their interests\n   19  before regulatory agencies, the legislature, the courts and other bodies\n   20  to ensure that public policies affecting the provision, quality and cost\n   21  of utility service fairly reflects  the  needs  and  concerns  of  these\n   22  consumers.  The  legislature  finds that such representation can best be\n   23  secured by the creation of not-for-profit organizations which are  under\n   24  the  control of their  memberships and solely responsive and responsible\n   25  to the memberships' goals and that this type of advocacy for small busi-\n   26  ness utility consumers requires the establishment of an efficient  fund-\n   27  ing  mechanism  whereby such consumers may voluntarily contribute to the\n   28  organizations.\n   29    For these reasons there should be established,  not-for-profit  corpo-\n   30  rations  known  individually as the \"Small Business Utility Board, Inc.\"\n   31  with the responsibility to  promote  adequate  representation  of  small\n   32  business utility consumers; to collect operating funds; to assist in the\n   33  redress  of  small  business utility consumer complaints; and to provide\n   34  for small business utility consumer membership in such corporations  and\n   35  small  business utility consumer direction of the actions of such corpo-\n   36  rations.\n   37    S 3.

The statement and the enclosure described in this section shall  be\n   38  of a size compatible with the utility's mailing envelope, shall have the\n   39  character of a circular and may not have the character of a bill, state-\n   40  ment of account, or personal correspondence, and shall otherwise conform\n   41  to  the  specifications  of the utility's billing enclosure requirements\n   42  and procedures. Each public utility company furnished with  such  state-\n   43  ments  or  other  enclosures  in  accordance with the provisions of this\n   44  section shall include or enclose such statements or enclosures with  the\n   45  next customer periodic billing which it mails or delivers to each of its\n   46  customers.\n   47    4.  The  total  weight  of the corporation's statements and enclosures\n   48  incorporated pursuant to this section in a customer's  periodic  billing\n   49  may  not  exceed one-half ounce avoirdupois. If the weight of the public\n   50  utility company's periodic customer  billing,  when  combined  with  the\n   51  corporation's  statements or other enclosures exceeds one ounce avoirdu-\n   52  pois, the corporation shall reimburse the utility for the  amount  which\n   53  is  the  same  proportion of the total postage or other delivery cost of\n   54  the billing as the weight  of  the  corporation's  statements  or  other\n   55  enclosures  is to the total weight of the mailing. The corporation shall\n   56  promptly reimburse with interest at the utility company's cost of  capi-\n\n       S. 1839                             6\n\n    1  tal such utility company for all other reasonable handling and enclosure\n    2  costs  in excess of the utility company's normal billing costs which are\n    3  incurred by the utility company in  complying  with  this  section.  The\n    4  corporation  may  postpone  for three months after the date of the first\n    5  election of directors under section twelve of this act reimbursement  of\n    6  the  utility  company  for  all  costs incurred through the date of such\n    7  election. If such utility company is unable to collect  any  amount  due\n    8  from  the  corporation  under this section within three months after the\n    9  date such amount  is  due,  that  utility  company  may  refuse  further\n   10  requests to mail an enclosure until the amount is paid, unless an action\n   11  to  resolve  the  dispute  with  respect to such costs is pending in the\n   12  appropriate state court.\n   13    5. A dispute arising from the  operation  of  this  section  shall  be\n   14  resolved  by negotiations between the corporation and utility, if possi-\n   15  ble, or by an action commenced in the appropriate state  court.  Neither\n   16  the  public utility nor the corporation may fail to comply with this act\n   17  by reason of the existence of such a dispute.\n   18    6. No public utility company or  officer,  employee,  or  agent  of  a\n   19  public  utility  company  may interfere or threaten to interfere with or\n   20  cause any interference with the  utility  service  of,  or  penalize  or\n   21  threaten  to  penalize or cause to be penalized, any person who contrib-\n   22  utes to the corporation or participates in any  of  its  activities,  in\n   23  retribution for such contribution or participation.\n   24    7.  No  public  utility  company  or  officer, employee, or agent of a\n   25  public utility company may prevent, interfere with, or hinder the activ-\n   26  ities described in subdivisions one through four of this section.\n   27    8. No person shall use any list of contributors  to  the  corporation,\n   28  nor  any part of such list, for purposes other than the conduct of busi-\n   29  ness of the corporation as prescribed  in  this  act.  No  person  shall\n   30  disclose  any such list or part thereof to any other person unless there\n   31  is substantial reason to believe that such list or part thereof  is  not\n   32  intended  to  be  used for the lawful purposes described in this act and\n   33  the board of directors approves such action.  Any  person  who  violates\n   34  this  subdivision  shall  be subject to a civil penalty of not more than\n   35  ten thousand dollars.\n   36    S 9. Board of directors. 1. The affairs of the  corporation  shall  be\n   37  managed by a board of directors consisting of twelve members.\n   38    2.  The directors shall serve without salary, but each director may be\n   39  entitled to reimbursement for actual and necessary expenses.  The  board\n   40  of  directors  shall establish standard allowances for mileage, room and\n   41  meals and the purposes for which such allowances may be made  and  shall\n   42  determine the reasonableness and necessity for such reimbursements.\n   43    3.  The  term of office for members of the board of directors shall be\n   44  three years and no member shall serve more than two  consecutive  terms.\n   45  One-third  of  the  directors  first  elected shall serve for a one-year\n   46  term; one-third of such directors shall serve a two-year term; and  one-\n   47  third of such directors shall serve a full three-year term.\n   48    4.  No  director shall, either directly or indirectly, be employed for\n   49  compensation as a staff member or consultant of the corporation.\n   50    5. Any director who shall handle, disburse, or receive money on behalf\n   51  of the corporation shall be bonded. Such bond shall be  a  cost  to  the\n   52  corporation.\n   53    S  10.  Duties of the board of directors.
