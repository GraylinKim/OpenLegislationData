  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2244\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the general business law, in relation to charges for\ncertain services rendered by a physician\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 of the General Business Law is amended by adding a new\nsection 338 which prohibits a physician from charging for any service\nwhatsoever rendered during a period of seventy-two hours from the\ntime such free service was rendered, except for those services\nspecifically excluded in the advertisement offering the free services.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIt is a commendable practice for physicians to offer free examinations\nto those individuals who may not otherwise receive a service.\nHowever, there have been instances in which many people, especially\nseniors, have been enticed into physician's offices through the\nadvertisement of a free service. Unfortunately, some unscrupulous\nproviders are taking advantage of the rapport and possible diagnosis\nthat was established during the free exam by charging for related\nservices. This is similar to the advertising gimmick of a \"bait and\nswitch\" in which an individual is lured in with the promise of one\nproduct (a free exam) and then switched to another product (the\nfollow-up service).\n\nThis legislation would require that a physician may not charge for any\nservice related to that for which the free service was rendered\nduring a period of seventy-two hours. Furthermore, if the free\nservice does not apply to all services to be rendered, the\nadvertisement must specify any associated or reasonably anticipated\nservices which are not included.\nFor example, free eye screening for services does not include charges\nfor refraction, eyeglasses and contact lens fitting.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to the state.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
