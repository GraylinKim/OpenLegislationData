  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2598\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to custodial interference and\nrepealing certain provisions of such law relating thereto\n\nPURPOSE:\nWith increasing recognition of the seriousness of parental abduction,\nthis bill is designed to overcome some of the significant obstacles\nto the recovery and return of missing children.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 amends subdivision 1 of section 135.45 of the Penal Law,\ncustodial interference in the second degree, by removing the\nrequirement to show that the abductor intended to hold the child\npermanently or for a protracted period, therefore making the focus of\nthe statute the actual \"taking\" or \"enticing\" of the child.\n\nSection 1 also amends subdivision 2 of section 135.45 of the Penal Law\nto define custodial interference in the second degree as the taking\nor enticing of a child, in the absence of a court order determining\nthe rights of custody or visitation, with intent to deny access,\ncustody or visitation rights of another to that child or for the\npurpose of evading the courts of this State.\n\nSection 1 also amends subdivision 3 of section 135.45 of the Penal Law\nto include within the definition of custodial interference in the\nsecond degree the wrongful withholding or failure to return such\nchild or incompetent person after expiration of any authorized\nvisitation period with intent to either intimidate or harass another\nwho has lawful custody or to prevent the other person from regaining\ncustody.\n\nSection 2 repeals section 135.50 of the Penal Law and adds a new\nsection 135.50 dealing with custodial interference in the first\ndegree and states that a person would be guilty of such offense when\nhe or she commits the crime of custodial interference in the second\ndegree and either:\ndetains or conceals a child or incompetent person from his or her\nlawful custodian with intent to hold the child permanently or for a\nprotracted period of time; or exposes the child or incompetent person\nto a risk in which his or her safety will be endangered or his or her\nhealth materially impaired; or removes the child or incompetent\nperson from the state.\n\nSection 3 adds three new sections (135.51, 135.52 and 135.53) to the\nPenal Law. Section 135.51 provides that it shall be an affirmative\ndefense to a prosecution if the child or incompetent person has been\nabandoned, threatened with or subjected to violence or was fleeing a\ndomestic violence situation. Section 135.52 provides that the court\n\nmay assess any reasonable expenses incurred by the lawful custodian\nor governmental unit searching for the child against any person\nconvicted under this section and may require such person to undergo\ncounseling at his or her own expense. Section 135.53 provides that\nlaw enforcement officers conducting investigations in these matters\nshall enter the case into the National Crime Information Center\n(NCIC) Computer and shall take the child or incompetent person into\nprotective custody and return such child or incompetent person to his\nor her lawful custodian, to the institution from which he or she is\nentrusted or to the court in which a custody proceeding is pending.\n\nSection 4 provides that this act shall take effect on the first day of\nNovember after enactment.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nExisting law requires that the abductor intends to hold the child\npermanently, which is almost impossible to prove and assumes that the\nwhereabouts of the abducted child are known.\nAdditionally, existing law does not make it a crime for one parent to\nconceal a child from his or her other parent in the absence of a\ncourt order.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nAccording to the federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency\nPrevention in its National Incidence Studies on Missing, Abducted,\nRunaway and Thrownaway Children in America (NISMART), there are as\nmany as 354,100 children abducted by a family member each year.\nThese cases account for nearly 75% of all abductions.\n\nThere is increasing recognition among experts of the seriousness of\nparental abduction and its long-term negative consequences. Many\nchildren suffer permanent physical and/or psychological trauma as a\nresult of the abduction. The left-behind parent, who is suffering\nwith anxiety and loss, must also shoulder the financial burden of\nconducting a search for the child.\n\nUnlike other state statutes, (e.g. California, N.J., Florida,\nWashington), the New York Statute is not comprehensive and only\nminimally effective. A New York citizen whose child was abducted by a\nfamily member is frequently placed at a terrible disadvantage in\ncomparison to a parent facing the same problem in another state,\nbecause of the difficult threshold needed to secure a felony warrant\nunder the New York law. This is critical because the classification\nof a family abduction as a felony triggers federal assistance for the\nvictimized child and parent. Because it is extremely difficult to\nprove the child's whereabouts, it is virtually impossible to\nestablish that the child has been taken out of the state. Unless a\nfelony warrant is issued, the FBI and other authorities will not\nintervene in the location effort. The National Center for Missing and\nExploited Children, for example, will not conduct a well renowned\nnational picture campaign or \"ADVO\" which has achieved a 7 out of 10\nchild recovery rate.\n\nAdditionally, the current statute fails to encompass all scenarios of\nabduction. Conditioning the definition on the existence of a custody\ndecree excludes large numbers of victimized parents and leaves many\nchildren vulnerable since abductions often occur during separation or\nprior to issuance of any order.\n\nFinally, family violence is increasingly recognized as a factor of\nabduction. This proposal broadens the existing defense provisions to\nprotect victims of domestic violence.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2008:     S.1077 - Referred to Codes\n2007:     S.1077 - Passed Senate\n2005-06:  S.465  - Passed Senate\n2003-04:  S.1924 - Passed Senate\n2001-02:  S.4235/A.1856A - Passed Senate, Held in Assembly\nCodes Committee\n1999-00:  S.4332/A.7236 - Passed Senate, Held in Assembly\nCodes Committee\n1997-98:  S.3249- Referred to Codes\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nFirst day of November after enactment.\n\n",
