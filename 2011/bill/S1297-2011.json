  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1297\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act to amend the alcoholic beverage control law, in relation to\nproviding funds for certain police services\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\n\nTo protect public safety and quality of life in areas affected by bars\nand clubs by authorizing on-duty police officials to provide additional\npolice services in an area, with the municipality being reimbursed by an\nentity representing more than one liquor licensees.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThis bill adds a new subdivision to &sect;128 of the Alcoholic Beverage\nControl Law, authorizing on-duty police to provide police services in a\nparticular area, where funds supporting the activity are paid to the\npolice department or municipality by an entity representing more than\none licensee, and personnel are on duty and under the command of the\npolice department.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nSome communities have been seriously affected by the noise, traffic and\neven criminal activity that can sometimes result from concentrations of\nbars and clubs in an area. Bar and club owners have expressed a willing-\nness to pay for additional police protection in affected areas, through\na program such as New York City's \"paid detail\" program.\n\nHowever, ABC Law &sect; 128 prohibits police officers from having any \"inter-\nest\" in a liquor licensee, including being paid by the licensee to\nprovide security or other services (with limited statutory exceptions).\nThis has raised questions as to whether licensees or entities represent-\ning a group of licensees may pay for \"paid detail\" arrangements with\nlocal police.\n\nThis legislation would authorize such an arrangement, at the option of\nthe municipality, with important protections for the police and the\npublic, to avoid any possible conflict of interest or inappropriate\nactivity. The police involved would at all times be on duty and under\nordinary police command, providing police services. Funding could not\ncome from anyone licensee, nor would it go directly from a licensee to\nthe police department or a police officer. The funding, which could\noriginate with licensees, would have to go through an entity (which\ncould be a trade association, a business improvement district, or other\norganization) representing more than one licensee, and it would go the\ndepartment or municipality. Police personnel would receive their ordi-\nnary compensation, and they would be providing ordinary police services\non duty and under police command. They would in no way be \"security\" for\na licensee.\n\nResponsible licensees would be able to support necessary additional\npolice services to help control and prevent disruptive and dangerous\nsituations.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009:  S.3343, Died in Investigations & Government Operations\n2010:  S.3343, Died in Investigations & Government Operations\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
