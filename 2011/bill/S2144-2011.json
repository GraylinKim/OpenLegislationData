  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2144\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the insurance law, in relation to\nthe\nreplacement of automobile glass\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo ensure a level playing field in the area of auto glass\ninstallation and repair.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nAmends section 2610(b) of the insurance law.\nThe bill seeks to prohibit insurers from attempting to recommend or\nsuggest that auto glass repairs be made at a particular place or shop.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nAllows insurers to recommend their insured use\nparticular auto glass repair shops. Current law, however, prohibits\ninsurers from making such recommendations for general auto repair\n(unless expressly requested by the insured).\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nInsurance companies are attempting to steer their own\ninsured to particular auto glass repair facilities - some of which\nhave corporate relationships with the insurer. There is no reason\nthat the repair of auto glass, an essential safety component of a\nvehicle, should be treated differently than the repair of other\nsafety mechanisms such as brakes. Consumer choice and safety should\nbe the premier concerns when it comes to auto glass installation.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.2895 of 2009:  Referred to Insurance\nS.477  of 2007:  Referred to Insurance\nS.3429 of 2005:  Referred to Insurance\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to State.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
