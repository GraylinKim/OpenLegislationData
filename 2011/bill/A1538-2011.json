Paragraph 3 of subsection (b)  of  section  3224-b  of  the\n    2  insurance law, as amended by chapter 237 of the laws of 2009, is amended\n    3  and two new paragraphs 6 and 7 are added to read as follows:\n    4    (3) A health plan shall not initiate overpayment recovery efforts more\n    5  than [twenty-four] TWELVE months after the original payment was received\n    6  by  a  health  care provider. However, no such time limit shall apply to\n    7  overpayment recovery efforts that are: (i) based on a reasonable  belief\n    8  of  fraud  or  other  intentional misconduct[, or abusive billing], (ii)\n    9  required by, or initiated at the request of,  a  self-insured  plan,  or\n   10  (iii) required or authorized by a state or federal government program or\n   11  coverage that is provided by this state or a municipality thereof to its\n   12  respective employees, retirees or members. Notwithstanding the aforemen-\n   13  tioned  time  limitations,  in  the  event  that  a health care provider\n   14  asserts that a health plan has underpaid a claim or claims,  the  health\n   15  plan may defend or set off such assertion of underpayment based on over-\n   16  payments  going  back  in time as far as the claimed underpayment.  [For\n   17  purposes of this paragraph, \"abusive billing\"  shall  be  defined  as  a\n   18  billing  practice which results in the submission of claims that are not\n   19  consistent with sound fiscal, business, or medical practices and at such\n   20  frequency and for such a period of  time  as  to  reflect  a  consistent\n   21  course of conduct.]\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD05377-01-1\n\n       A. 1538                             2\n\n    1    (6)  A  HEALTH  PLAN SHALL NOT DETERMINE AN OVERPAYMENT AMOUNT THROUGH\n    2  THE USE OF EXTRAPOLATION EXCEPT WITH THE  CONSENT  OF  THE  HEALTH  CARE\n    3  PROVIDER,  EXCEPT  WHERE THERE IS A REASONABLE BELIEF OF FRAUD OR INTEN-\n    4  TIONAL MISCONDUCT.\n    5    (7)  A  HEALTH  CARE  PLAN  MAY NOT THREATEN TO SANCTION A HEALTH CARE\n    6  PROVIDER INCLUDING A REPORT TO A RELEVANT DISCIPLINARY BODY AS A  RESULT\n    7  OF  A  HEALTH  CARE  PROVIDER  CHALLENGING AN ALLEGED OVERPAYMENT EXCEPT\n    8  WHERE THERE IS A REASONABLE BELIEF OF FRAUD OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT.
