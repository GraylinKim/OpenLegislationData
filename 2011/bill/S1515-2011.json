  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1515\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the alcoholic beverage control law, in relation to the state\npolicy with regard to alcoholic beverages\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nTo update the overall articulated state public policy regarding the\nregulation of the manufacture of alcoholic beverages in New York.\nThis policy was first articulated by the New York State Legislature\nwhen adopting the first Alcoholic Beverage Control Law after repeal\nof the 18th Amendment (Prohibition) to the United States Constitution\nin 1933.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nSection 1: Amends Alcoholic Beverage Control Law section 2 \"Policy of\nstate and purpose of chapter\". This amendment adds that the policy of\nthe State Liquor Authority is to also consider promoting the economic\ndevelopment and job opportunities of this State when pursuing its\nregulatory activities with regard to the State's beer, wine, and\nliquor production industries. This policy consideration is in\naddition to the already articulated policy to control the manufacture\nof alcoholic beverages in this State.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\n\nUnder current law, the State Liquor Authority, in its activities, is\nto consider the control of the manufacture and sale of alcoholic\nbeverages without any consideration to the economic benefits and job\ncreation possibilities that are derived from promoting activities\nthat relate to the manufacture of beer, wine and liquors.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nThe overall environment in which the regulation of the manufacture,\nsales and consumption of alcoholic beverages has changed greatly\nsince the public policy statement contained in section 2 of the\nAlcoholic Beverage Control Law was first adopted in 1933. Since,\n1933, the Great Depression is over, the Allied Forces won the Second\nWorld War, and the Cold War is now over. Further, consumer\npreferences and consumption patterns for alcoholic beverages have\nchanged significantly since the policy statement contained in Section\n2 was adopted over 85 years ago.\n\nIt is now time to modernize the overall policy with regard to\nregulating the manufacture of alcoholic beverages so that its\nreflects the social\nbenefits that can be derived to the State of New York by encouraging\nthe production of quality beer, wine, and spirits. Expanding\nproduction facilities that manufacture beer, wine, and liquors in\nthis State can increase the demand for state produced agricultural\ncrops, preserve working farms and open spaces, minimize future real\n\n\nproperty tax increases, and promote economic opportunities related to\nagri-tourism industries.\n\nThis bill will give regulators the tools that they need to consider\nthe economic development and job opportunities that can be created by\npromoting the prudent expansion of the manufacture of beer, wines,\nand liquors.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2008: A.10314 Referred to Economic Development\n2010: A.6184Referred to Investigations & Government Operations\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediate.\n\n",
