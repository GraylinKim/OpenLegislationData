  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1341\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the highway law, in relation to authorizing the leasing of land\nadjacent to state and local highways for the purpose of the construction\nand operation of solar and wind electric generating systems;\nand to amend the public authorities law, in relation to granting such\nauthorization to the metropolitan transportation authority\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo authorize the lease of lands adjacent to state and county\nhighways for operation of wind or solar electric generating systems.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 amends Section 10 of the highway law by adding a\n new subdivision 38-a.\n\nSection 2 amends Section 102 of the highway law by adding a new\nsubdivision 19.\n\nSection 3 amends Section 140 of the highway law by adding a new\nsubdivision 20.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThis legislation will help to spur economic\nopportunities in alternative energy as well as energy independence by\ncreating a mechanism for the leasing of lands adjacent to state and\ncounty highways for operation of wind or solar electric generating\nsystems.\n\nOther states have already pioneered the use of highway right of ways\nfor siting alternative solar energy generating systems. In 2008, the\nState of Oregon installed the country's first solar project in a\nhighway right of way. The project consists of a 104 kW solar\nphotovoltaic system that covers 8,000 square feet- roughly the length\nof two football fields- and produces 112,000 kWh each year. The solar\npanels produce electricity during the day, giving the power to the\nPGE grid, and getting the equivalent amount of power back at night\nfrom PGE to power lighting on the highway_ Electricity for the\nhighway interchange is provided by PGE and the added solar power is\nhandled through a net metering arrangement A live monitoring log is at:\nhttp://www.live.declunonitoring.com/?id=solarhighway\n\nSacramento Municipal Utility District in California will also be\nbuilding solar arrays along state highways, starting with a\n1.5-megawatt project along Highway 50. This solar highway project\nreceived $5 million\nin federal funding in January 2010, authorized by the American\nRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.\n\nNew technologies also exist for solar panels that double as sound\nwalls reducing highway noise near residential neighborhoods. Solar\nsound bathers are in used in Switzerland, Germany and Australia.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010: S.7734/A.10243\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNo fiscal implications.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
