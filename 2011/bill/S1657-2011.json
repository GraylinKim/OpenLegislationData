  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1657\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to deeming students who engage in\nsexual conduct with an employee or volunteer of the school such student\nattends as being incapable of consent\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nProhibits sexual student/teacher relationships regardless of the fact\nthat the student may be 18 years old or older.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 (h) of section 130.05 of the penal law is amended to add a\nnew paragraph (i). This new paragraph includes the\nstudent-teacher/volunteer relationship in elementary or secondary\nschool within the purview of section 130.05. Students are deemed\nincapable of consent regardless of the fact that they may be 18 years\nold or older.\n\nEFFECTS OF PRESENT LAW WHICH THIS BILL WOULD ALTER:\nCurrently the age of consent is 18 years of age. There is no law\nprohibiting a relationship between a student and teacher if the\nstudent is 18 years or older. This bill would prohibit such\nrelationships.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe relationship between a student and a teacher or volunteer is one\nof trust and reliance. Teachers and school employees provide students\nwith knowledge, structure, guidance, positive examples and\nfriendship. This special relationship of trust and admiration could\nleave students vulnerable to the sexual advances of school staff\nStudents can easily confuse their platonic love and admiration for a\nteacher with feelings of a more intimate nature. While an 18-year old\nstudent may not realize that they are being exploited, the teacher or\nvolunteer should know that such advances or relationships are\ninappropriate. This bill seeks to protect vulnerable young people\nfrom the inappropriate advances of those they trust.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the thirtieth day after it shall have\nbecome a law.\n\n",
