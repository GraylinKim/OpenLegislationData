  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1733\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the executive law, in relation to establishing the \"access to\npublic services for non-English speakers act\"\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nTo provide individuals with limited English proficiency equal access\nto state departments, agencies and programs.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nRequires state agencies to take reasonable steps to provide equal\naccess to public services for individuals with limited English\nproficiency, by providing in-house oral language services for\nresidents with limited English proficiency; translating vital\ndocuments ordinarily provided to the public into any language spoken\nby any limited English proficient population constituting at least\nthree percent of the overall population served by the state agency;\nand any additional methods or means necessary to achieve equal access\nto public services.\n\nEach state agency is also required to adopt regulations at least six\nmonths in advance of adoption in order to effectuate the intent and\npurpose of the legislation, and consult with the Attorney General on\ncentral coordination and technical assistance with compliance with\nthe legislation.\n\nThe proposed act would take effect immediately upon enactment.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nDuring the 1990s, the population of foreign-born u.s. residents rose\nto 31 million, more than 10 percent of the total population.\nAccording to data from the 2000 Census, 21.3 million of those\nforeign-born residents do not speak English \"very well,\" up from 13.9\nin 1990. Yet, because state agencies generally offer information and\nservices only in English, many residents are unable to access the\nassistance they qualify for and need. In New York, for example, when\nthe state closed walk-in unemployment offices in 1997 and required\nworkers to file unemployment claims through a telephone system, most\nnon-English speakers were left at a severe disadvantage.\n\nIn 2001, the united States Supreme Court ruled in Alexander v. Sandoval.\n532 US 275, that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act did not guarantee\nlanguage access rights. This means that the federal government will not\nsolve the problem.\n\nMaryland, Massachusetts and California have enacted comprehensive laws\nto make public services accessible to workers with limited knowledge\nof English. Connecticut and california allow individuals to file\ndiscrimination complaints when access to public services is denied as\na result of limited English proficiency. statutes exist in Nebraska,\nIowa and Connecticut that require employers to give immigrant workers\nnotice of their workplace rights in their own language.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n2010: S.2274-A  Referred to Finance\n      A.5333-A  Referred to Governmental Operations\n2008: S.2472    Referred to Finance\n      A.5077    Referred to Governmental Operations\n2006: S.5315    Referred to Finance\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nThere is a minimal fiscal impact anticipated with implementation of\nthe requirements of this legislation.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nImmediately.\n\n",
