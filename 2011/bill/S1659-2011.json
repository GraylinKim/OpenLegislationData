  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1659\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to health care fraud\n\nPURPOSE:\nThe purpose of this bill is to decrease the amount of wrongfully\nreceived payments needed to trigger higher statutory criminal\nclassification.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 177.10 of the penal law is amended from $3,000 to $1,000.\nSection 177.15 of the penal law is amended from $10,000 to $5,000\nSection 177.20 of the penal law is amended from $50,000 to $25,000\nSection 177.25 of the penal law is amended from $1 million to $500,000\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nThe current amount of fraud required for health care fraud in the 4th\ndegree through 1st degree is $3,000; $10,000; $50,000 and $1 million\nrespectively.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe current dollar amounts required to trigger higher degrees of the\ncrime of health care fraud are unacceptably high. New York must not\ntolerate the loss of health care funding to fraud. Nor should we as a\nState allow lenient treatment of individuals who view health care\nfraud as a \"business\". According to the National Health Care\nAnti-Fraud Association, health care fraud costs the United States\napproximately $94 billion in 2004 alone. One estimate indicated that\nhealth care fraud costs every man, woman and child in the United\nStates $11 per week or $550 per year. New York must make every effort\nto reduce health care fraud. Reducing fraud will reduce health care\ncosts. Even one fraudulently submitted claim or one bill for services\nnever performed is too many. Under the current system of law, a\nphysician who charges $200 per visit for patients he/she never\nactually sees could submit 14 fraudulent claims before triggering the\nhigher level crime contained in section 177.10.\n\nUnder this hypothetical example, the claims would not only cost money\nbut would cost insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid etc\" time and\nresources investigating and processing these bogus claims, Other\ncrimes involving theft such as grand larceny are triggered at $1,000,\nTheft of health care funds and services should not be treated\ndifferently.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.7275 of 2008\n03/26/08 Referred to Codes\nS.111 of 2009\n\n01/07/09 REFERRED TO CODES\n01/06/10 REFERRED TO CODES\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
