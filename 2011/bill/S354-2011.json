ROBACH -- read twice and ordered printed, and when\n         printed to be committed to the Committee on Commerce, Economic  Devel-\n         opment and Small Business\n\n       AN  ACT to amend the economic development law and the public authorities\n         law, in relation to  authorizing  the  job  development  authority  to\n         create and administer the bank export incentive program with the tech-\n         nical assistance of the department of economic development\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and\n    2  declares  that the economy of the state of New York can be bolstered and\n    3  enhanced through the sale of additional products and services  from  New\n    4  York  state  to  customers in foreign countries. The legislature further\n    5  finds that one of the impediments to an increase in  export  sales  from\n    6  New  York state is the unavailability of loans at a competitive interest\n    7  rate for relatively small amounts of money  borrowed  for  time  periods\n    8  between  one  and  five years from the commercial banks of our state and\n    9  nation. It is further found that one of  the  major  reasons  that  such\n   10  monies  are  unavailable  is  the  high cost of processing such loans by\n   11  banking organizations because of the complexities of international tran-\n   12  sactions. The legislature, therefore, finds and declares that it  is  in\n   13  the  interest of a stronger and more viable economy for the state of New\n   14  York to encourage the banking industry of our state to  provide  medium-\n   15  term  financing  for  low  dollar volume export transactions through the\n   16  creation of a bank export incentive program.\n   17    S 2.  Subdivision 47 of section 100 of the economic  development  law,\n   18  as renumbered by chapter 427 of the laws of 2008, is renumbered subdivi-\n   19  sion 48 and a new subdivision 47 is added to read as follows:\n   20    47.
