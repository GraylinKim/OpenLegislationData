  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1416\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law and the correction law,\nin relation to establishing penalties for\nfailure to provide a DNA sample and failure to register or verify\nas a sex\noffender\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo create criminal penalties in two instances: where a convicted sex\noffender fails to meet his or her obligation under to Sex Offender\nRegistration Act (SORA); and where a convicted offender refuses or\nfails to provide a DNA sample as provided by sections 995(7) and\n995-c(3) of the Executive Law.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 amends the Penal Law by adding two new sections 195.01 and\n195.02 providing that a person who is required under law to provide a\nDNA sample must do so within 30 days or face misdemeanor charges for\nthe first offense or an E felony for a second and subsequent offense.\n\nSection 2 amends the Penal Law by adding two new sections 195.03 and\n195.04 providing that a person who is required under law to register\nas a sex offender, and who fails to do so, may be charged with a\nclass E felony upon the first offense, and a class D felony upon\nsubsequent offenses.\n\nSection 3 amends section 168-t of the Corrections Law to clarify that\nthe failure of a sex offender to register or verify may be considered\nfor a violation of parole or probation.\n\nSection 4 provides the effective date, which is the first of November\nnext succeeding the date on which it shall have become law.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nCurrently, a convicted sex offender who fails to register or verify\nhis or her information as required under SORA may be charged with a\ncrime under section 168-t of the correction law. A first time offense\nis a class E felony and any subsequent offense is a class D felony.\nThere is no\npenalty provided, specifically, for failure or refusal to provide a\nDNA sample and many convicted offenders flout their obligation.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) was an important initiative\nin the pursuit to keep our communities safe. However, because failure\nto register is a Correction Law felony and not a Penal Law felony, it\ndoes not constitute a predicate felony with regard to enhanced\nsentencing.\n\nMoving the offense of \"failure to register\" to the Penal Law would\nimprove compliance with the important public safety initiative of\nSORA by making offenders who repeatedly refuse to comply with their\nsex offender obligations subject to enhanced sentences.\n\nUnder Executive Law sections 995(7) and 995-c(3), certain crimes\nrequire the convicted to provide a DNA sample. The success of New\nYork State's DNA data bank depends on it being as complete as\npossible. Nevertheless, many convicted criminals continue to flout\nthe law and refuse to comply. Offenders are occasionally charged with\nobstructing governmental administration in the second degree (section\n195.05 of the Penal Law), though this was not the original intent of\nsection 195.05. Several states have addressed this problem with\nstatutes that provide a misdemeanor penalty or fines. Creating a\nmisdemeanor offense in New York for failure to provide a DNA sample\nwould provide an incentive to comply with the current law.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2008: S.7984A - Passed Senate\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThe first of November next succeeding the date on which it shall have\nbecome law.\n\n",
