  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2064\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public service law, in relation to requiring annual\ninspections of manholes, service box covers and utility poles\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill requires the annual inspection of manholes, service\nbox covers and utility poles.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 amends the public\nservice law by\nadding a new section 73. It requires that every gas and electric\ncorporation annually inspect their manholes, service box covers and\nutility poles to determine if there is voltage present in them.\n\nThe gas and electric corporations shall keep records of the\nexamination and make them available for public inspection.\n\nFailure to comply with any of these provisions shall result in a civil\npenalty up to $1,000 for the first violation and up to an additional\n$2,000 for each succeeding violation occurring within a one year\nperiod.\n\nSection 2 enacts this bill on the thirtieth day after it shall become\nlaw.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nEarly this year (January and February\n2004), Con Edison\nfound several \"hot spots\" citywide - manholes and service box covers\ncharged with electricity ranging up to 130 volts. An electric shock\nfrom 50 volts of electricity is enough to disrupt a person's heart\nbeat with as little as one second of contact. Death may result after\nminutes of contact. Manhole covers become electrified due to the\ncorroding of wires from weather conditions compounded by the salt\nused to melt ice and snow.\n\nThis bill seeks to alleviate the fears that our city streets may be\nunsafe to pedestrian traffic. Utility companies have an obligation to\nensure that their utility poles and service boxes are safe for\npassersby. Shoddy, quick-fix cables and temporary wiring are\nunacceptable.\nAnnual inspections will require the utility companies to maintain\ntheir service boxes properly. Written inspection records will prove\nthat the utility company is complying with its inspection requirements.\n\nCity residents must feel confident that the metal plates and manhole\ncovers in their streets are safe. Any future tragedies must be\navoided and the utility companies must be held responsible.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nNew bill.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to the state.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the thirtieth day.\n\n",
