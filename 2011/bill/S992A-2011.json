  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S992A\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to theft of a companion animal or\npet\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\n\nCreates first and second degree pet theft offenses.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\n\nSection 1: The penal law is amended by adding three new sections:\n165.75, 165.76 and 165.77 to create the felony offenses of pet theft\nin the first and second degree.\n\nA person is guilty of pet theft in the second degree when he/she\nsteals a companion animal or pet, which is defined as a dog, cat or\nother domesticated animal normally maintained in or near the\nhousehold of the owner or person who cares for such animal. Pet theft\nin the second degree is a class E felony and carries a maximum\nsentence of four years imprisonment.\n\nA person is guilty of pet theft in the first degree when he/she\ncommits pet theft in the second degree, and when (1) such animal is\nsold for scientific research purposes; or, (2) with no justifiable\npurpose, he or she intentionally kills or intentionally causes\nserious physical injury to such companion animal or pet with\naggravated cruelty. Pet theft in the first degree is a class D felony\nand carries a maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment.\n\nSection 2: Effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nPets often provide companionship that mirrors that of a best friend or\nloved one. When a pet is stolen, it feels as if a loved one has been\nkidnapped. Unfortunately, the law does not currently acknowledge the\nseverity of loss in these sad situations. Pet theft is currently\nprosecuted, if at all, as a petit larceny, misdemeanor offense -\nsupposing the loss of a beloved pet is similar to that of any stolen\npersonal property. Pets, however, occupy a special place in our\nhearts, homes and society and should, therefore, be distinguished\nunder the law.\n\nThis bill was amended to change the numbering of sections created.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n2010 - S.6354 REFERRED TO CODES - A.9429 Referred to Codes\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nNone to the state.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nImmediately.\n\n",
