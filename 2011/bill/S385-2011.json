KRUEGER, HASSELL-THOMPSON, HUNTLEY, PARKER, SERRANO,\n         STAVISKY  --  read  twice  and ordered printed, and when printed to be\n         committed to the Committee on Health\n\n       AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation  to  requiring  ciga-\n         rette  manufacturers  to  disclose the chemical substances used in the\n         manufacture of cigarettes\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section  1.  Legislative findings. It has been the policy of the state\n    2  to guarantee and facilitate the public right to know  concerning  health\n    3  risks  that  may  be  encountered  from manufactured products and at the\n    4  workplace. The legislature finds that literally  thousands  of  chemical\n    5  substances  are  routinely  utilized in the manufacture of cigarettes as\n    6  burn retardants, preservatives, flavor enhancers and for other aesthetic\n    7  purposes and that such chemicals may have toxic effects for both smokers\n    8  and nonsmokers. Therefore, the legislature further finds that the public\n    9  has a right to know the chemical substances used in the  manufacture  of\n   10  cigarettes  and  what  toxic  effects, if any, these additives have been\n   11  found to have or are suspected of having.\n   12    S 2. Article 13-F of the public health law is amended by adding a  new\n   13  section 1399-mm-1 to read as follows:\n   14    S  1399-MM-1. DISCLOSURE BY MANUFACTURERS OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS. 1.
