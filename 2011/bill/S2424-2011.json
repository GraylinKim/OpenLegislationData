  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2424\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the executive law, in relation to the establishment of the New\nYork State veterans cemetery act\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nThis bill seeks to establish a New York State Veterans Cemetery Program.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\n\nSection 1 of this bill would provide that this law shall be known and\nmay be cited as the New York State Veterans Cemetery Act.\n\nSection 2 of this bill would amend the executive law to add a new\nsection 367 to establish a New York State Veterans Cemetery Program.\nPursuant to such section, the New York State Division of Veterans\nAffairs would be directed to conduct an investigation and study on\nthe issue of the establishment of a New York State Veterans Cemetery\nProgram. Such investigation and study would be required to be\ncompleted on or before December 31, 2012. Within 90 days of the\ncompletion of such investigation and study, such Division must also\ncomplete and deliver, to the chair of the Senate Standing Committee\non Veterans, Homeland Security and Military Affairs and the chair of\nthe Assembly Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs, a report on such\ninvestigation and study, containing recommendations to the\nlegislature on the establishment of a New York State Veterans\nCemetery Program. Such recommendations shall include what measures\nneed to be taken by New York State to establish such a program, what\nlaws should be amended or added to establish such a program, and what\nfiscal resources would need to be appropriated and expended, if any,\nto establish such program.\n\nSection 3 of this bill would provide for an immediate effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nNew York State presently exists in a dangerous and uncertain world.\nLike in generations before, our veterans have answered the call and\nhave placed themselves as the defenders of our freedoms and liberties.\n\nThis bill seeks to provide the mechanism for the establishment of a\nNew York State Veterans Cemetery Program. Such a program is a\nnecessary and prudent step toward recognizing the commitment and\nsacrifice our state's veterans have made Such a program, by terms of\nthis bill, would be developed in partnership with the New York State\nDivision of Veterans Affairs, after thoughtful study and investigation.\n\nThe report and recommendations required under this bill would provide\nthe framework for the establishment of the Program, upon which a\nsuccessful establishment and implementation could be based. This bill\nseeks to direct New York State's Veteran recognition and services in\na responsible, thoughtful manner, using experience and intelligence\nto seek the best possible outcome for those who have given so much of\nthemselves for all the people of our State.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\nThis is a new bill.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nNone noted, for although some staff time at the New York State\nDivision of Veterans Affairs would be required to accomplish the\ninvestigation, study and report required under this bill, its actions\ncould easily be performed with current resources.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis bill would take effect immediately.\n\n",
