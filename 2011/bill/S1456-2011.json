  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1456\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the environmental conservation law, in relation to authorizing\nthe catching and possession of five times the daily limit for any\nspecies of fish during any seven consecutive day period and authorizing\nthe catching and possession on a single vessel of the daily limits of\nany species of fish for which a person aboard such vessel holds a\nlicense for the taking thereof; and providing for the repeal of such\nprovisions upon the expiration thereof\n\nPURPOSE:\nAuthorizes the catching and possession of up to 5 times the\ndaily limit of fish during any seven day period of time.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThe Environmental Conservation law is amended\nby adding a new section 13-0373 relating to the aggregation of daily\nand trip catch and possession limits.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThis bill is intended to help commercial fishermen\nconserve fuel by allowing them to fish for five times the daily catch\nlimit allowable under their fishing license in the aggregate over a\nperiod of seven days.\nTherefore, a fisherman could, for example, catch three times the daily\ncatch limit on Monday and two times the limit on Wednesday and then\nstay off the water until the following Monday when a consecutive\nperiod of seven days is over. The bill also would allow individuals\nwith different fishing licenses to go out and catch each of their\ndaily limits from the same boat (this is currently prohibited).\n\nThe reason for this legislation is that the current price of fuel for\nrunning a fishing boat is extremely expensive and cost prohibitive.\nIt significantly cuts into the already slim profits of fishermen who\nare trying to make a living. This bill would allow fishermen to\nconserve fuel by keeping their boats off the water more often since\nthey would be allowed to aggregate their daily catch limits over a\nseven day period. The fact that they can only catch five times the\namount of fish in the aggregate over a seven day period creates a\nfair balance for the convenience and cost-savings they would enjoy.\nThis bill would sunset on January 1, 2013 at which time the success of\nthis approach could be fully evaluated and the necessity of an\nextension determined.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-10: A.854/S.376 - Remained in Environmental Conservation Committee\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately and shall\nexpire and be deemed repealed on January 1, 2013.\n\n",
