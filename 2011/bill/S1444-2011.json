  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1444\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the social services law, in relation to establishing the\ncommunity capital loan program and providing for the filing of a report\nthereon\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo allow individuals on public assistance and the working poor to\nqualify for small, low~interest loans for the purpose of becoming\nself-employed.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 amends the social services law by adding a new section\n131-bb, which does the following:\n\nSubdivision 1 authorizes the Department of Labor to solicit proposals\nto establish programs to be known as community capital loan program?\nSuch programs shall provide small, low interest loans to persons with\nincomes below two hundred percent of the federal poverty level for\nthe purpose of assisting the loan recipient to become self-employed.\nSuch loans shall not constitute income or resources for the purposes\nof public assistance so long as the funds are used for the intended\npurpose;\nSubdivision 2 authorizes the Commissioner of Labor to enter into\nwritten agreements with not-for-profit organizations or local\ngovernment agencies (program site) for the purpose of administering\nloan pools; Subdivision 3 designates how sites will be approved and\nhow funds will be applied.\n\nSection 2 outlines the necessary information to be reported by the\nprogram site to the Department of Labor, and from the Department of\nLabor to the Legislature.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nwith more individuals moving from welfare to work, it is necessary to\ncreate stable, decent-paying jobs that will allow individuals to\nremain off public assistance. One way to address this problem is by\nencouraging self-employment for those who have the capability.\nSeveral agencies in Albany County have indicated that they would like\nto provide loans to welfare recipients for the purpose of becoming\nself-employed. Further, as large corporations downsize, small\nbusiness is one of the fastest growing employment sectors in our\neconomy. Facilitating self-employment for both welfare recipients and\nthe working poor will allow them to enter this growing field.\nCreating a \"community capital loan program\" would benefit welfare\nrecipients across the state. It may also prevent certain low-income\nindividuals from ever becoming dependent on public assistance.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:;\n\n2009/2010 - S.415 Senate Committee on Social Services, Children, and\nFamilies discharged and Committed to Social Services\n2007/2008 - S.742 Remained in the Senate Committee on Social\nServices, Children and Families\n2005/2006 - S.234 Remained in the Senate Committee on\nSocial Services, Children and Families\n\n 0us on;FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:;\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:;\nImmediately.\n\n",
