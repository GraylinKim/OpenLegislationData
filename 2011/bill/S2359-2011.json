SEWARD, LARKIN -- read twice and ordered printed,\n         and when printed to be committed to the Committee on Transportation\n\n       AN ACT to amend the transportation law, the state finance law,  the  tax\n         law  and  the  public  authorities  law,  in relation to programs that\n         promote and protect the safety of truck drivers in New York state\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as \"Jason's Law\".\n    2    S 2. Legislative intent. The legislature finds and declares that there\n    3  is  a great need to provide truck drivers with safe places to rest while\n    4  waiting for pending appointments or to  comply  with  federal  hours  of\n    5  service  regulations.  Federal  law  requires motor carrier operators to\n    6  rest for a period of ten hours  after  driving  for  eleven  consecutive\n    7  hours.  Federal law further prohibits motor carrier operators from driv-\n    8  ing more than sixty hours over a seven day  period.  These  requirements\n    9  are  only  exacerbating  the  shortage  of  safe parking areas for motor\n   10  carriers, forcing many drivers to park in  desolate,  poorly  lit  areas\n   11  with  little  or  no security. Many shippers and receivers of freight do\n   12  not allow truckers into their facilities until just before their  sched-\n   13  uled  appointment time and insist that they leave promptly once delivery\n   14  is complete. It is imperative that the legislature address  the  current\n   15  shortage  of  long-term  parking for commercial motor vehicles to ensure\n   16  the personal safety and  security  of  those  who  transport  goods  and\n   17  provide essential services for the people of the state of New York.\n   18    S  3.  The transportation law is amended by adding a new section 140-a\n   19  to read as follows:\n   20    S 140-A. MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY AND SECURITY REVOLVING LOAN PROGRAM.  1.\n   21  THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY AND\n   22  SECURITY  REVOLVING LOAN PROGRAM TO PROVIDE LOANS TO ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS\n   23  TO MAKE SAFETY  AND  SECURITY  UPGRADES  ON  THEIR  FACILITIES  FOR  THE\n   24  PURPOSES DESIGNATED IN THIS SECTION.

The state finance law is amended by adding a new section 99-t  to\n   36  read as follows:\n   37    S  99-T.  MOTOR  CARRIER  SAFETY  AND SECURITY REVOLVING LOAN FUND. 1.\n   38  THERE IS HEREBY ESTABLISHED IN THE JOINT  CUSTODY  OF  THE  STATE  COMP-\n   39  TROLLER  AND  THE COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION AND FINANCE A SPECIAL FUND TO\n   40  BE KNOWN AS THE MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY AND SECURITY REVOLVING LOAN FUND.\n   41    2.
