This act shall be known and may be cited as\n   22  the \"State Comptroller Campaign Finance Reform Act\".\n   23    S 2. Legislative findings and declaration. The legislature is  commit-\n   24  ted  to  reforming  New  York's  campaign  finance system and bolstering\n   25  public confidence in the democratic process. Whether or not a system  of\n   26  large  campaign  contributions  creates  actual  unfair  influence,  the\n   27  appearance and perception of such influence gives rise  to  distrust  in\n   28  government  and citizen apathy that could undermine the democratic poli-\n   29  tical process.\n   30    The legislature finds that the high cost of  running  a  campaign  for\n   31  statewide  office  in  New  York  discourages  qualified candidates from\n   32  running and inevitably forces candidates to spend too much time  raising\n   33  money  rather than attending to official duties and concentrating on the\n   34  issues that do  concern  and  should  concern  voters.  Addressing  such\n   35  concerns  in  the  context  of the election to the office of state comp-\n   36  troller is an appropriate place to start in reforming New York's  system\n   37  of  campaign  finance; the state comptroller campaign finance reform act\n   38  is a first step.\n   39    Therefore, the legislature finds that limiting campaign  contributions\n   40  to a level that is sufficient to permit candidates to raise money to run\n   41  an  effective,  statewide  campaign  as  title  II  of article 14 of the\n   42  election law requires,  furthers  the  state's  legitimate  interest  in\n   43  reducing real and perceived unjust influence on government. Such title's\n   44  program of voluntary expenditure caps combined with public financing and\n   45  a  minimal  threshold  for  participation  in  the program, furthers the\n   46  state's interest in encouraging qualified candidates to run  for  office\n   47  regardless of their access to substantial wealth, thus increasing public\n   48  debate and participation in the democratic process. The legislature also\n   49  believes  that such title's voluntary spending caps ensure a level play-\n   50  ing field for all candidates who participate.\n   51    Thus, the legislature enacts the state  comptroller  campaign  finance\n   52  reform  act  with  the  express purpose of furthering all of these state\n   53  interests which, if strengthened, will only make  the  election  process\n   54  more open and fair and, ultimately, more democratic.\n\n       S. 1314                             5\n\n    1    S  3.

  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1314\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the retirement and social security law, in relation to making\ntechnical corrections relating to the investment advisory committee and\nthe mortgage advisory committee (Part\nA); to amend the executive law, in relation to prohibiting the use of\nplacement agents by managers doing business with the common retirement\nfund (Part B); to amend the executive law, in relation to the adoption\nof a code of conduct by the state comptroller (Part C);\nto amend the election law, in relation to enacting the \"State\nComptroller\nCampaign\nFinance Reform\nAct\"; to amend the election law, the state\nfinance law and the tax law, in relation to providing for optional\npartial public financing of certain election campaigns in this state;\nand to amend the\nelection law, in relation to identification of the source of certain\npolitical communications\n(Part D); to amend\nthe executive law, in relation to authorizing the state comptroller to\nestablish a timeframe and frequency for reporting information relating\nto transactions of the common retirement fund (Part E); to amend the\nretirement and social security law, in relation to\nthe\nestablishment of the variable interest rate bond liquidity and\nmonoline insurer investment program;\nto amend the retirement and social security law, in relation to the\ninvestment of moneys in in-state private equities; and to amend the\nretirement and social security law, in relation to the investment of\nmoneys in real assets (Part F); and to amend the executive law, in\nrelation to creating a fair fund program for the collection of civil\npenalties assessed upon perpetrators of frauds against the common\nretirement fund (Part G)\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nThis bill enacts into law major\ncomponents of legislation which are necessary to implement the New\nYork State common retirement fund reformation act.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\n\nPart A\n\nProvides for defense and indemnification to existing members of the\ninvestment advisory committee; and changes the name of the mortgage\nadvisory committee to the real estate advisory committee, and\nprovides for defense and indemnification for the members of such\ncommittee.\n\nPart B\n\nProhibits an employee of the Fund from knowingly and willfully making\nany commitment of the assets or resources of the Common Retirement\nFund (Fund) to any investment manager if the investment manager has\nengaged, hired, utilized, or retained for compensation a placement\nagent or intermediary for the purpose of securing or influencing a\ndecision by\nthe Fund. Defines a placement agent or intermediary as any person or\nentity, including a registered lobbyist, that is, for compensation,\nhired, engaged, utilized or retained for facilitating the placement of\nany investment with the investment manager. A placement agent or\nintermediary is not a regular employee of the investment manager.\n\nDefines an investment manager as any person or entity, other than an\nemployee of the State Comptroller, engaged by the Fund in the\nmanagement of an investment portfolio of the Fund.\n\nPart C\n\nRequires the State Comptroller to adapt a code of conduct to govern\nthe operations of the Common Retirement Fund.\n\nThe Code of conduct may include, hut need not be limited to: fiduciary\nduties of the State Comptroller; the requirement of an investment\npolicy statement for the Fund, duties of the advisory council and\ncommittees including but not limited to the investment committee,\nreal estate advisory committees, audit committee, and the actuarial\ncommittee, fiduciary duties of employees of the Office of State\nComptroller who have responsibility for matters relating to the New\nYork State and Local Employees' Retirement system (NYSLERS), the New\nYork State and Local Police and Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS),\nand the Fund, including but not limited to fiduciary and ethics\ntraining and compliance with the provisions of public officers law,\npolicies to prevent the misuse of material and confidential\ninformation by officers and employees' guidelines for internal\naudits of NYSLERS, NYSLPFRS, and the Fund; fiduciary duties and\nconflict of interest disclosure policies for investment managers,\nconsultants, and advisors to the Fund, guidelines for the procurement\nof services of investment managers, consultants, and advisors,\nguidelines for the audit of fees by the superintendent of Insurance,\nguidelines for the investigation of complaints of abuse within\nNYSLERS, NYSLPFRS, and the Fund, guidelines for the maintenance of\nall books and records of NYSLEOS, NYSLPFRS, and the Fund, guidelines\nfor an annual audit of NYSLERS, NYSLPFRS, and the Fund; and\nguidelines for the publication of information related to NYSLERS,\nNYSLPFRS, and the Fund including but not limited to fund performance\nand transactions.\n\nPart D\n\nEstablishes the State Comptroller Campaign Finance Reform Act.  The\nbill amends Article 14 if the election law to designate the existing\nlaw Title and adds an identification requirement for independent\npolitical communications, a filing requirement for independent\nexpenditures and a requirement that certain candidates disclose\ntheir intent to spend personal funds in a campaign.\n\nIt also adds a new Title II to Article 14 to\nprovide for public financing of primary and general campaigns for\nthe office of state comptroller.\n\nTo participate, a candidate for the office of state Comptroller\nmust satisfy all requirements for participation, including raising\nnot less than $300,000 from at least 3,000 matchable contributions\nmade up of sums of up to $250 per individual contributor who resides\nin New York state.  All candidates who choose to participate in the\npublic financing system have a contribution limit of $2,000\nper contributor.\n\nMatchable contributions may be collected after January first of the\nyear of the primary or general election and consist of the net amount\nof contributions after deduction of the value of any food, drink or\nentertainment provided in exchange for the contribution. only\ncontributions from persons who reside in New York State are\nmatchable. Eligible contributions up to $250 are matched at the rate\nof $4 for every $1.\n\nIf, however, a candidate who does not elect to receive public funds\nraises, spends or contributes his or her own personal funds in an\namount greater than the expenditure limit established for such office\nfor candidates participating in the public financing system, an\nadditional grant of public funds is given to the participating\ncandidate. The grants equal 25% of the amount of public funds\npreviously received by the candidate as a match for matchable\ncontributions obtained and reported to the state board of elections.\nEach of the grants is added to the original expenditure limit,\neffectively creating a new trigger for the next grant when the\nnon-participating candidate raises, spends or contributes his or her\nown personal funds in an amount greater than the new expenditure limit.\n\nPublic funds may be used only for qualified campaign expenditures\nduring the year of the primary or general election. The following\nexpenditure limits apply to all state comptroller candidates who\nparticipate in the public financing system: in the general election,\n$8,000,000; in the primary, $1.1 per enrolled voter or $600,000,\nwhichever is more, but not to exceed $6,000,000. In addition, a state\nparty committee may make up to $1,000,000 in expenditures for\nservices to participating state comptroller candidates the party has\nnominated; transfers may constitute up to 25% of such party\nexpenditures.\n\nThe bill provides for an income tax check-off of $5. If the state\ncampaign finance fund lacks the money to pay all properly certified\nclaims, the deficiency will be paid from the general fund.\n\nThe bill would impose penalties for the knowing and willful failure to\nidentify the source of campaign communications; the failure to file\nrequired statements; and for exceeding the expenditure limits.\n\nPart E\n\nProvides that the State comptroller in consultation with the\nSuperintendent of Insurance, may establish the frequency for\nreporting certain information to be published on the Comptrollers'\nwebsite related to the transactions of the Common Retirement Fund,\nsuch as investment performance results, proxy voting records, asset\nallocation, and performance figures.\n\nPart F\n\nAuthorizes the Comptroller to establish a variable interest rate bond\nliquidity and monoline insurer investment program (program). The\nComptroller may invest up to $1 billion in variable interest rate\nbond liquidity and up to $500 million in monoline insurer\ninvestments. The Program would assist entities of State and local\ngovernments and other issues of municipal and public debt to secure\nmore favorable financing\nterms by providing letters of credit, standby bond purchase agreements\nand similar liquidity facilities for variable interest rate bonds,\nand investing in existing or new monoline insurers that enhance such\ntypes of debt.\n\nThere will be limitations on the size of the Program: The aggregate\noutstanding balance of obligations enhanced as part of variable\ninterest rate bond liquidity shall not exceed ten percent of the\nassets of the Fund; the aggregate outstanding balance of obligations\nenhanced for a single issuer shall not exceed two percent of the\nassets of the Fund; the aggregate outstanding balance of obligations\nenhanced as part of monoline insurer investments shall not exceed\nlive percent of the assets of the Fund, and the maximum liability for\nthe Fund as a result of its\ninvestment in any monoline insurer shall not exceed the dollar about\nof such investment.\n\nAdds the following to the list of eligible investments of the public\nretirement funds in the State, subject to the following limits:\nIn-State Private Equity Investments, not to exceed $1.5 billion; real\nassets, not to exceed $1 billion, including but not limited to\ncommodities, natural resources, and timber.\n\nSuch in-State private equities shall have: An investment strategy\ndesigned to provide returns consistent with similar, non-New York\nfocused investments; a coherent investment strategy consistent with\n\nthe business environment; an ability to raise capital from other\nsources;\nand an investment strategy designed to result in business presence in\nthe State.\n\nPart G\n\nExempts the Common Retirement Fund from a provision of current law\nthat provides that any money credited to the State as the result of a\ncause, or action shall vest in the State. Under the bill, funds that\naccrue as a result of a cause of action related to the Common\nRetirement Fund shall be deposited into such Fund, and the State may\nnot deduct the expenses incurred in the acted from any money owed to\nthe Common Retirement Fund.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThis bill will increase the\nindependence, transparency\nand oversight of the New York state common retirement fund; reduce\nconflicts of interest and increase the public's confidence in the\nmanagement of such fund; and permit a candidate for state Comptroller\nto run for office free of the appearance of undue influence.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010: A.9029\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATION:\nThere would be minimal administrative costs to the\nOffice of the State Comptroller related to the provisions of this\nbill requiring that the State Comptroller promulgate a code of conduct.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately; provided however, that each individual\npart shall take effect as provided at the end of such part.\n\n",
