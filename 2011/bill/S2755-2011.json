  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2755\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the education law, in relation to piggyback contracts for school\ndistrict transportation services\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nThis Bill would allow school districts to share transportation\nservices for students living on shared transportation routes by\nentering into a joint contact with another school district and that\nschool district's transportation contractor, a practice referred to\nas a \"piggyback contract.\"\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nParagraph h(2) of subdivision 25 of section 1709 of the education law\nallows the board of education to enter into a \"piggyback contract\"\nwith another school district provided that the contract will result\nin savings to the school district. In order for a school district to\nbe able to enter into a \"piggyback contract,\" the school district\nwhich they would like to contract with. (1) must already be providing\ntransportation to its own students through an existing contract with\na private transportation contractor, (2) the school district desiring\nto enter into a \"piggyback contract\" must also enter into a contract\nwith the private transportation contractor and each school district\ninvolved and (3) all school districts involved must abide by the\nterms and conditions of the existing transportation contract.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nAs the law stands now, a school district will frequently travel\nthrough other school districts in the process of transporting their\nstudents to and from school. Many times they will pass by students in\nother districts who are going to the same school, but are transported\nby their own school district. This practice results in excess cost to\nthe State because school districts are duplicating services when one\nbus could pick up multiple students in more than one district. This\nlegislation promotes efficiency and savings by allowing school\ndistricts to share transportation costs.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n2009-10, S.1370; 2007-08, S.7615.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nNone\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nImmediately, with provisions.\n\n",
