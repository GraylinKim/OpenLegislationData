  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1835\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law,\nin relation to vehicular assault and vehicular\nmanslaughter\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo establish new criminal sanctions and\nenhance existing\ncriminal sanctions in order to adequately deter and punish motorists\nwho injure or kill pedestrians or other drivers as a result of\ndangerous and unlawful driving.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 of the bill would amend the Penal Law\nby adding new &sect;120.03-a, establishing the crime of Vehicular Assault\nin the Third Degree, a class E felony. Vehicular Assault in the Third\nDegree would be committed when a driver seriously injures another and\nthe driver (a) knows that his or her license was suspended or revoked;\nor (b) the driver was operating his or her vehicle in violation of\nTitle VII (\"rules of the road\") of the Vehicle & Traffic Law (\"VTL\")\nthereby causing the injury and had two or more prior VTL violations\nin the last 18 months; or (c) is impaired by his or her use of\nalcohol in violation of VTL &sect;1192(1). An affirmative defense that the\nserious physical injury was caused in whole or substantial part by\nsome factor other than the driver's impairment or the manner in which\nthe driver was operating the vehicle would be established.\n\nSection 2 would amend Penal Law &sect;120.03 to redefine the crime of\nVehicular Assault in the Second Degree. The level of the crime would\nbe raised from a class E to a class D felony. Changes also would\ninclude eliminating the element of criminal negligence from the crime\nof Vehicular Assault in the Second Degree when a driver is\nintoxicated or his or her ability is impaired by alcohol and drugs\nand he, or she, while operating a vehicle, motor vehicle, vessel,\nsnowmobile or all terrain vehicle, causes serious physical injury to\nanother person. Section 2 also would provide an affirmative defense\nwhere such serious physical injury was primarily caused by some\nfactor other than either the driver's intoxication or impairment by\nalcohol and drugs or the manner in which he or she operated the\nvehicle while so intoxicated or impaired. The crime would also\ninclude commission of the crime of Vehicular Assault in the Third\nDegree with Criminal Negligence.\n\nSection 3 would amend Penal Law &sect;120.04 by increasing the penally for\nthe crime of Vehicular Assault in the First Degree from a class D\nfelony to a class C felony, and redefining the crime so as to punish\noffenders who (a) with intent to evade a police officer after having\nreceived a lawful signal to bring the vehicle to a stop, operate a\nvehicle in\nviolation of the VTL's \"rules of the road\" and causes serious physical\ninjury; (b) operate a vehicle with a blood alcohol content of or (c)\ncommit the crime of Vehicular Assault in the Second or Third Degrees\nand have a prior Vehicular Assault, Vehicular Manslaughter or\n\n\nCriminally Negligent Homicide involving a vehicle conviction. This\nsection also includes an affirmative defense where such serious\nphysical injury was primarily caused by some factor other than the\ndriver's intoxication or the manner in which the driver operated the\nvehicle.\n\nSection 4 would amend the Penal Law by adding new &sect;125.11,\nestablishing the crime of Vehicular Manslaughter in the Third Degree,\na class D felony. Like Vehicular Assault in the Third Degree,\nVehicular Manslaughter in the Third Degree would be committed when a\ndriver causes the death of another and the driver (a) knows that his\nor her license was suspended or revoked; or (b) the driver was\noperating his or her vehicle in violation of the VTL's \"rules of the\nroad,\" thereby causing the death and had two or more prior VTL\nviolations in the last 18 months; or (c) is impaired by his or her\nuse of alcohol in violation of VTL &sect;1192(1). The section also\nestablishes the affirmative defense that the serious physical injury\nwas caused in whole or substantial part by some factor other than the\ndriver's impairment or the manner in which the driver was operating\nthe vehicle.\n\nSection 5 would amend Penal Law &sect; 125.12 to redefine the crime of\nVehicular Manslaughter in the second Degree. The level of the crime\nwould be raised from a class D to a class C felony. Changes also\ninclude adding subdivision 4 regarding suspended licenses.\nSubdivision 5 adds any violation of Title VII of the Vehicle &\nTraffic Law other than subdivisions two, three or four of &sect;1192 and\nalso if the driver has been previously convicted of two or more\nviolations of Title VII of the Vehicle & Traffic Law on at least two\nseparate dates within the immediately preceding eighteen months.\n\nSection 6 of the bill would provide that the bill would take effect\nimmediately.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nAn alarming number of pedestrians and others are\nseriously hurt or killed each year by dangerous drivers operating\ntheir vehicles in violation of the VTL's \"rules of the road.\" Many of\nthese dangerous drivers are operating a vehicle despite prior\nconvictions that resulted in the suspension or revocation of their\nlicense. While such drivers are sometimes held criminally accountable\nif there is compelling proof of gross negligence or recklessness, all\ntoo often under current law such dangerous behavior and deadly\nresults can only be charged as a simple traffic infraction.\n\nVEHICULAR ASSAULT AND VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER REFORMS\n\nCurrent law fails to adequately address the significant problem of\ndrivers who flagrantly violate the VTL's \"rules of the road\" by\nspeeding, refusing to obey traffic signals, or by committing other\n\"moving\" violations, even when such driving results in the tragedy of\na pedestrian injury or death. Prosecutors are unable to charge\ndrivers who seriously injure or kill innocent bystanders under the\nexisting Vehicular\nAssault and Vehicular Manslaughter crimes, even when the serious\ninjury or death was the direct result of the driver's VTL violation,\nabsent proof of gross negligence. In addition, Prosecutors must have\n\n\nproof of such criminal negligence in order to charge drivers who are\nnot licensed to operate a vehicle (often because their licenses have\nbeen revoked or suspended as a result of past misdeeds) with the\ncrimes of Vehicular Assault and Vehicular Manslaughter. This\nunfortunate reality offends the public conscience and invalidates the\nunderlying objective of licensing drivers, and should be addressed.\n\nRecognizing, however, that a driver's violation of the VTL may not, in\nall cases, be a direct cause of another person's death or injury, the\nbill provides an affirmative defense where such serious physical\ninjury or death was primarily caused by some factor other than the\ndefendant's driving.\n\nVEHICULAR ASSAULT AND VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER REFORMS - INTOXICATION\n\nIn 1983, the Legislature created the felony crimes of Vehicular\nAssault and Vehicular Manslaughter to provide harsher penalties for\nintoxicated drivers. These statutes, however, have not achieved that\npurpose because prosecutors are still required to prove that the\ndriver acted with criminal negligence - a difficult standard to prove\nsince courts have ruled that driving while intoxicated, by itself,\ndoes not constitute criminal negligence. The unfortunate result is\nthat drunk or impaired drivers who cause another person's death or\nserious physical injury cannot be charged with vehicular assault or\nmanslaughter unless they have committed additional traffic\ninfractions like speeding or running a red light.\n\nThis deficiency in existing law is best illustrated by example. In\nSuffolk County, an intoxicated driver crashed into the vehicle of an\ninnocent 31 year-old driver who died as a result of his injuries.\nDespite the tragic results of this heinous crime, the drunk driver\ncould not be charged with vehicular manslaughter since he did not\ncommit a traffic infraction other than drunk driving. Incredibly, he\nreceived only a conditional discharge and a fine. Also in Suffolk\nCounty, a drunk driver, who struck and killed an unsuspecting teenage\ngirl as she stood near the side of a road, shamefully could only be\ncharged with a misdemeanor due to the onerous criminal negligent\nrequirement. Current law intolerably enables drunk drivers to escape\npunishment for victim injuries and deaths. By removing the element of\ncriminal negligence from the crime of Vehicular Assault in the Second\nDegree and Vehicular Manslaughter in the Second Degree when there is\nproof of intoxication, the bill provides law enforcement with\nappropriate tools to effectively prosecute and punish drunk drivers.\n\nRecognizing, however, that a driver's ingestion of alcohol or drugs\nmay not in all cases be a direct cause of another person's death or\ninjury, the bill provides an affirmative defense where such serious\nphysical injury or death was primarily caused by some factor other\nthan the defendant's intoxication or impairment. For example, an\nintoxicated or impaired driver lawfully parked at the side of the\nroad \"sleeping off\" the effects of his or her intoxication or\nimpairment conceivably could be struck by another vehicle. In that\ninstance, if the driver who \"primarily caused\" that accident suffers\nserious physical injury or\ndeath, the intoxicated or impaired individual would be able to assert\nthe affirmative defense and avoid liability for the other driver's\ninjuries or death.\n\n\nVEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER REFORMS - EVASION OF A POLICE OFFICER\n\nIn addition to working diligently to reduce the number of\ndrunk-driving tragedies, New York State strives to keep its highways\nand other, thoroughfares free from other unsafe drivers as well.\nOften, serious injuries and fatalities have occurred due to drivers\nwho display an outrageous disregard for the well-being of others by\ntraveling in excess of the speed limit and refusing to comply with\nlawful police orders.\n\nA tragedy in Queens perhaps best illustrates the importance of\ncreating new crimes and enhancing penalties for these motorists who\nseriously injure or kill. A man led police on a high speed and deadly\nchase through the streets of a Queens neighborhood. In his wake, he\nleft two elderly women dead and a 63-year-old man in critical\ncondition. Regrettably, under current law this driver can only be\ncharged with a class C felony. Under the bill, a person who leads the\npolice on a high-speed chase that results in the death of another\nwill be charged with Vehicular Manslaughter in the First Degree, a\nclass B felony, thereby exposing such an offender to 25 years in\nstate prison.\n\nThe following list of similarly tragic crimes further underscores the\nneed for legislation that adequately addresses the cowardly and\ndeadly acts of those who refuse to adhere to the rules of the road\nand fail to heed the instructions of law enforcement personnel.\n\n* After leading police on a 110 mile per-hour chase through the\nstreets of a small town in upstate New York, a motorist lost control\nof his vehicle and plowed into a restaurant and delivery truck\nkilling two 27-year-old men.\n\n* In November of 1996, a motorist, after refusing a State Trooper's\ninstruction to stop his vehicle, led the State Police on a 95 mile\nper hour chase which resulted in a crash that left a 13-year-old girl\ndead.\n\n* In 2001, a State Trooper stopped a vehicle for a traffic infraction.\nAs the State Trooper approached the vehicle on foot, the driver sped\noff and struck a tree, killing his 21- and 22-year-old passengers.\n\nThe bill also makes conforming changes to the crime of Vehicular\nAssault in the First Degree. Under the bill, those who violate the\nrules of the road while evading pursuing police officers and cause\nserious physical injury will be subject to swift prosecution for a\nclass C felony.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2008: Passed Senate/Assembly Codes Cmte.\n2010: S.4168 Reported out of Codes; Advanced to Third Reading\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nIt is not anticipated that this legislation will\nhave any significant fiscal impact.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n\n",
