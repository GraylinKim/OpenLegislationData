PARKER, PERKINS -- read twice and ordered printed,\n         and when printed to be committed to the Committee on Education\n\n       AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to  education  on  celiac\n         disease;  and  to  amend  the  tax  law  and the state finance law, in\n         relation to the celiac disease awareness and research fund\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds the\n    2  following:\n    3    a. Celiac disease is a digestive disease that damages the small intes-\n    4  tine and interferes with absorption of nutrients from food.\n    5    b. Celiac disease affects people in all parts of the world. Originally\n    6  thought to be a rare childhood syndrome, celiac disease is now known  to\n    7  be a common genetic disorder.\n    8    c. More than two million people in the United States have the disease,\n    9  or about 1 in 133 people.\n   10    d. People who have celiac disease cannot tolerate gluten, a protein in\n   11  wheat,  rye, and barley. Gluten is found mainly in foods but may also be\n   12  found in everyday products such as medicines, vitamins and lip balms.\n   13    e. When people with celiac disease eat foods or use products  contain-\n   14  ing gluten, their immune system responds by damaging or destroying villi\n   15  the  tiny,  fingerlike  protrusions  lining  the  small intestine. Villi\n   16  normally allow nutrients from food to be absorbed through the  walls  of\n   17  the  small  intestine  into  the  bloodstream.  Without healthy villi, a\n   18  person becomes malnourished, no matter how much one eats.\n   19    f. People with celiac disease may  have  no  symptoms  but  can  still\n   20  develop  complications of the disease over time. Long-term complications\n   21  include malnutrition which can lead to anemia, osteoporosis and  miscar-\n   22  riage,  among  other  problems such as liver diseases and cancers of the\n   23  intestine.\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD01799-01-1\n\n       S. 1139                             2\n\n    1    g. For these reasons, and because this legislation will  have  signif-\n    2  icant savings to New York, the legislature finds it in the public inter-\n    3  est to raise awareness of this disease.\n    4    S  2.  The  education  law is amended by adding a new section 804-e to\n    5  read as follows:\n    6    S 804-E. EDUCATION REGARDING CELIAC DISEASE AWARENESS. 1.
