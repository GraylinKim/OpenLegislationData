  "fulltext" : "\nLEGISLATIVE  RESOLUTION mourning the death of Apolinar Trinidad, legend-\nary Dominican political activist and civil rights leader\n\nWHEREAS, It is with great sorrow and deep regret that  this  Legislative\nBody  records  the passing of Apolinar Trinidad, noting the significance\nof his purposeful life and accomplishments; and\n  WHEREAS, Apolinar Trinidad, affectionately known as Trinidad or Trini,\ndied on Wednesday, January 19, 2011, at the age of 60; he was a fiercely\nindependent leader largely credited with pioneering a movement for elec-\ntoral empowerment and immigrant rights; and\n  WHEREAS, Born in Samana, Dominican Republic, on October 12,  1950,  to\nFrancisca  and  Aquilino  Trinidad,  Apolinar  Trinidad  migrated to the\nUnited States at the age 19; for over 27 years, Trinidad was employed by\nthe New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal as  a  Rent\nProgram  Specialist advising tenants on the complicated maze of New York\nState housing laws; he graduated from Bronx Community College and  later\nstudied at Columbia University; and\n  WHEREAS,  In  the  early  1980s,  Apolinar Trinidad co-founded Latinos\nUnited for Political Action (LUPA), an independent civil  rights  organ-\nization dedicated to championing Latino electoral and immigrant empower-\nment;  Dominican  electoral  aspirations  were limited by high levels of\nnoncitizenship, and in what has been described as a  watershed  for  New\nYork's Dominican participation, Trinidad organized a Dominican electoral\nfront  that resulted in the first Dominican representation to the Commu-\nnity Development Agencies (CDA) Advisory boards that permitted  nonciti-\nzen voting and distributed a significant amount per year in anti-poverty\nfunds to community groups; and\n  WHEREAS,  Apolinar  Trinidad  later  became  a  CDA  official  and was\nappointed as a representative on that board;  that  same  year,  he  was\nelected to New York City Community School Board 6 in Washington Heights;\nand\n  WHEREAS,  In 2000, Apolinar Trinidad brought a then relatively unknown\ncandidate, Michael Bloomberg, to  Washington  Heights  for  a  community\nbreakfast at a local restaurant in order to outline his platform for the\nLatino  community;  Trini's activities were not limited to the electoral\narena during this crucial period of activism in the 1980s and  1990s  in\nthe  Latino community, but he would also engage in a whirlwind of activ-\nity in defense of immigrant rights; and\n  WHEREAS, As the City's demographics  changed  from  a  largely  Puerto\nRican  to  a  more  diverse Latino population, Apolinar Trinidad partic-\nipated in efforts to curb police misconduct  of  all  nationalities;  as\npart  of  the  Latino  Coalition for Racial Justice (LCRJ), he helped to\nlead the protest against the police killing of Juan Rodriguez, a Domini-\ncan immigrant in Brooklyn; and\n  WHEREAS, The slogan, \"Hoy Por Juan Rodriguez,  Manana  Por  Nosotros,\"\n(Today  for Juan Rodriguez, tomorrow all of us) became a rallying cry in\nLatino communities throughout the city against police brutality; and\n  WHEREAS, Apolinar Trinidad's organization, Latinos  United  for  Poli-\ntical  Action,  would pursue changes in major public policy initiatives;\nhe held meetings and wrote appeals to former  Bronx  Congressmen  Robert\nGarcia,  who  chaired  the  House  Committee  of the Census, to create a\n\"Dominican\" nationality check-off so that the city and state could gauge\nthe growing number of Dominicans in the local communities; and\n  WHEREAS, Apolinar Trinidad presented a major policy address in 1988 to\nthe Federation of Dominican  Merchants  in  the  Dominican  Republic  on\neconomic  development  efforts  between  the  Dominican Republic and the\nDominican Diaspora in the United States, and also called on  the  United\n\nStates  to pay reparations to the Dominican Republic for the invasion of\n1965; Trini was an active member and  union  representative  of  DC  37,\nworking  to  ensure  that all workers obtained their economic rights and\nwere able to preserve their pensions and benefits from the city; and\n  WHEREAS,  Later in his life, Apolinar Trinidad became an active member\nof the Unity Church and called on the Latino leadership along  with  his\nfollowers to embrace a divine moral compass that would give his communi-\nty,  caught  in a political and economic crisis, a new spiritual founda-\ntion; and\n  WHEREAS, Through his persistent advocacy, Apolinar Trinidad was one of\nthe behind-the-scene forces that laid the foundation for  a  new  gener-\nation  of leadership in the Dominican community and the City at large; a\ntrue asset to society, he fought for the human rights of people of every\nrace, nationality, and gender; and\n  WHEREAS, Apolinar Trinidad is survived by his  mother  Francisca,  his\nson  Socrates,  his  brother Miguel and his grandchild, Adrianna Fatima;\nand\n  WHEREAS, Armed with a  humanistic  spirit,  imbued  with  a  sense  of\ncompassion,  and  comforted by a loving family, Apolinar Trinidad leaves\nbehind a legacy which will long endure the  passage  of  time  and  will\nremain  as  a  comforting  memory  to all he served and befriended; now,\ntherefore, be it\n  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause  in  its  deliberations  to\nmourn  the  death  of  Apolinar  Trinidad, legendary Dominican political\nactivist and civil rights leader; and be it further\n  RESOLVED, That a copy of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be tran-\nsmitted to the family of Apolinar Trinidad.\n",
