  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2214\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the mental hygiene law, in relation to establishing the\ncommunity chemical dependence services expansion program and providing\nfor the repeal of such provisions upon expiration thereof\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nThe bill amends the Mental Hygiene Law to add a new section 26.01 to\ndirect the Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS)\nto use funds attributable to reductions in expenditures for medically\nmanaged chemical dependence detoxification to provide grants to fund\nthe Community Chemical Dependence Services Expansion Program. Grants\nwill be distributed directly from OASAS to non-profit entities, and to\nlocal governmental units in proportion to the unmet need for\nchemical dependency services. The act will sunset on March 31, 2016.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nThe New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and OASAS\nhave undertaken efforts to reduce the over utilization of New York\nCity's medically managed detoxification services by increasing the\navailability of, and incentives for patients to utilize less\nrestrictive and less expensive alternatives. This substitution will\nresult in more appropriate care as well as very significant savings\nfor the State.\n\nThe proposed legislation will ensure that savings achieved by the\nsubstitution of less restrictive alternatives for medically managed\ninpatient detoxification will be reinvested in New York State's\nchemical dependency services system, and that community-based\nagencies receive the resources necessary to provide treatment and\nlink clients to ongoing care.\n\nThe funds saved and reinvested will be necessary to fill any\nidentified gaps, support initiatives that bring evidence-based\ntreatment into practice in the community-based service sector, and\nimprove the outcomes for people living with chemical dependency.\nInitiatives that should benefit from such reinvestment include: case\nmanagement, shelter and ambulatory-based detoxification centers,\nbuprenorphine and methadone treatment capacity expansion, and\nservices for patients with co-occurring psychiatric and addictive\ndisorders.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n2010:  S.2192 - Referred to Mental Health & Developmental Disabilities\n2008:  S.7514 - Referred to Mental Health & Developmental Disabilities\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nThis bill will be funded on projected savings resulting from the\ndecreased reliance on hospital based detox services Providing more\neffective treatment will allow more people to get off of public\nassistance and increase revenues for the state.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis act shall take effect immediately and expire on March 31, 2016.\n\n",
