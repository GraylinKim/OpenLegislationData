  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1315\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the alcoholic beverage control law, in relation to agreements\nbetween small brewers and beer wholesalers\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nThis bill amends the ABCL to allow\nsmall brewers whose annual volume is less than 300,000 barrels of\nbeer and whose sales to a wholesaler are (3%) or less of a\nmulti-brand beer wholesaler's annual business, the right to terminate\nan agreement providing they pay the wholesaler fair compensation,\nexcept when the termination is for \"good cause\" as provided in\nSection 55-c of the ABCL.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nSection one of this bill amends\nSection 55-c of the ABCL by adding a new subdivision 4-c. The bill\ndefines small brewer in terms of barrelage and share of a wholesalers\nbusiness (as above) and provides for ending an agreement with a beer\nwholesaler subject to certain terms relating to the payment of fair\ncompensation to the beer wholesaler for the transfer of the small\nbrewers' brands. Additionally, the bill gives the beer wholesaler the\nright to submit to binding arbitration regarding \"fair market value\"\nand requires the small brewer to pay all arbitration costs if the\n\"value\" is not a \"good faith\" estimate. The bill provides for a\nprospective effective date of January 1, 2010, to allow both beer\nwholesalers and small brewer suppliers a 6 month period to work out\nany concerns they may have prior to the acts effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe Beer Franchise Law passed in 1996 and was amended\nin 2001 with the purpose of protecting beer wholesalers which were\nsmaller local and often family owned businesses from arbitrary\ntermination by large multinational breweries and ensure if they did\nagree to sell their distribution rights they would receive fair\ncompensation. Over the period this law has been in existence much has\nchanged in the brewing industry. There has been significant\nconsolidation in the beer wholesaler industry as a result of the law\nby the major multinational breweries. As a result New York\nwholesalers have diminished in number from 112 in 1996 to less than\n60 today and those wholesalers that remain in business have\nconsiderable resources and have gotten much bigger. At the same time\nthe number of smaller independent breweries in New York State has\ngrown tremendously from less than 20 in the early 90's to 63 today.\nToday the opportunity for growth for many small brewers is restricted\nbecause of contracts that require them to exclusively do business\nwith a particular wholesaler that is not actively supporting or\nselling their brand. Yet they are not able to terminate the contract\nand appoint another wholesaler except through a lengthy and\n\npotentially costly legal process that has little assurance of success.\nPresent remedies under the law do not work for small brewers. If the\nwholesaler does not want to be terminated they threaten expensive\nlegal action knowing that the smaller brewer does not have the\nresources to afford the legal battle, thus many small brewers have to\nlive with being \"locked in\" with relationships that are not working.\nIt was never the intention of the Law to be used by the wholesaler to\nlock small breweries into a relationship. Thus this bill provides a\nfair and appropriate amendment to the Beer Franchise Law. It does not\ndisrupt the workforce; jobs will not be lost. On the contrary it will\nallow small brewers to accelerate the growth they are already\nachieving and thereby create more good job opportunities in New York.\nThe bill allows the wholesaler, if they believe they have not been\nfairly compensated, to dispute the \"fair market value\" paid by the\nbrewer through binding arbitration. By requiring payment of fair\nmarket value and arbitration, this bill will promote a competitive\nand efficient system of distribution of the small brewers brands, and\nmake such brands more available in New York State, creating jobs and\nhelping a small but growing\nindustry.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009:  A.488-B - Passed Assembly\n2008:  A.9055B/S.6101 - Veto Memo 92\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThe first of January next succeeding the date on which it shall have\nbecome a law.\n\n",
