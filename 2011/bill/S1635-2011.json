  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1635\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to increasing penalties for the\ncriminal sale of firearms\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nTo increase the penalties for the criminal sale of firearms in order to\ndeter further sale of illegal weapons.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 amends section 265.13 of the penal law to increase the\npenalty for criminal sale of a firearm in the first degree from a\nclass B felony to a class A felony.\n\nSubsection 2 amends section 265.12 of the penal law to increase the\npenalty for criminal sale of a firearm in the second degree from a\nclass C felony to a class B felony.\n\nSubsection 3(a) includes the criminal sale of a firearm in the second\ndegree (265.12), the criminal sale of a firearm with the aid of a\nminor (265.14), and the criminal sale of a firearm to a minor\n(265.16) as class B violent felonies, as listed in paragraph (a) of\nsubdivision I of section 70.02 of the penal law.\n\nSubsection 4 amends section 265.11 of the penal law to increase the\npenalty for the criminal sale of a firearm in the third degree from a\nclass D felony to a class C felony.\n\nSubsection 5 (b) classifies the criminal sale of firearms in the third\ndegree (265.11) as class C violent felonies, as defined in paragraph\n(b) of subdivision 1 of section 70.02 of the penal law.\n\nSubsection 6 amends section 265.16 of the penal law to increase the\npenalty for the criminal sale of a firearm to a minor from a class C\nfelony to a class B felony.\n\nSubsection 7 amends section 265.14 of the penal law to increase the\npenalty for the criminal sale of a firearm with the aid of minor from a\nclass C felony to a class B felony.\n\nEFFECTS OF PRESENT LAW WHICH THIS BILL WOULD ALTER:\nThe current law does not include penalties harsh enough to effectively\ndeter the criminal sale of firearms.\n\nThis bill would amend the current law so that those who participate in\nthe criminal sale of firearms will face more stringent penalties,\nthus deterring them from selling firearms. As a result, the number of\ncrimes that include the use of an illegal firearm will decrease\nsignificantly.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe criminal sale of firearms consistently threatens the safety of our\nstreets by placing weapons in the hands of individuals who would\notherwise be denied access. Unfortunately, in New York State, the\nstatistics relating to illegal firearms are surprisingly high. The\nAlbany Times Union (2004) reported that there were over 16,000\nweapons seized in New York State in 2003; however, there were only 57\nindividuals charged with the criminal sale of a firearm. This is\nunacceptable.\n\nThere have been a total of eleven NYPD officers shot since June 2005;\ntwo of these officers were killed. In a recent incident, the men that\nattacked one of New York City's bravest were charged with the\ncriminal possession of a weapon. In order to ensure the safety of all\nNew Yorkers, in the wake of these tragic violent crimes, the New\nYork State Legislature must pass legislation that aids in deterring\nthese violent crimes. One imperative step in this process is ensuring\nthat the number of New Yorkers who illegally possess a firearm\ndecrease. This can be accomplished by increasing penalties for those\nwho illegally sell firearms; therefore, taking some of these\nindividuals off the streets and deterring others from making illegal\nsales.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.3114 of 2007 02/23/07\nS.109 of 2009\n01/07/09 Referred to Codes\n01/06/10 Referred to Codes\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the first of November next succeeding\nthe date on which it shall become a law.\n\n",
