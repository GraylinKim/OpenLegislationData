  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1445\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the education law, in relation to local approval of charter\nschools in certain districts\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo ensure some local oversight over charter schools outside of New\nYork city.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nAmends section 2851-a of the education law to require a charter school\nto submit an application to the local school board for approval\nbefore an application can be submitted to a chartering entity. This\napplication must include an economic and financial impact statement\nin addition to other information relevant to the application. If the\nlocal school board does not approve the charter school application,\nthe applicant cannot apply to a chartering entity.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nCurrently, there have been twelve charter schools approved for the\nAlbany city school District. Under current law, the school district\nhas no input into the approval process of charter applications and\nthat has resulted in the district's saturation. The goal of this\nlegislation is to provide school districts with input into a process\nwhere the outcomes affects them greatly. While the charter schools\ndeserve adequate funding, the formula on how they receive this\nfunding is flawed. The Albany city School District has to take on the\nburden of eliminating their programs, resources, as well as faculty\nin order to fund these charter schools.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009/2010 - S.336 Remained in the Senate Committee on Education\n2007/2008 - S.715 Remained in the Senate Committee on Education\n2005/2006 - S.7137 Remained in the Senate Committee on Education\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThe act shall take effect on the July 1st after it shall have become\nlaw.\n\n",
