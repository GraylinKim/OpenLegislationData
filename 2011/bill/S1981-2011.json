  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1981\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public service law, in relation to the power of the public\nservice commission to require refunds of or reductions in rates for\ninadequate or interrupted electric or steam service\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nIn its January 2007 report, the Assembly Queens Power outage Task\nForce recommended several measures to improve oversight of utilities\nand prevent future blackouts. This bill provides for prompt,\nmeaningful rate refunds or reductions in cases where an electric\nutility fails to meet its statutory duty to provide the public witb a\nsafe and adequate supply of power.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nBill &sect; 1 amends subdivision 20 of &sect; 66 of the Public Service Law to\nrequire the Public Service Commission (PSC) to impose prompt,\nmeaningful rate refunds or reductions in instances where electric\ncorporations fail to meet objectively measured service quality\nstandards. Refunds or reductions shall at a minimum equal 5% of the\namount billed to a customer for at least a 12-month period, subject\nto possible minimum and maximum cutoffs prescribed by the PSC. The\nbill also establishes minimum reimbursements for service outages in\ncities with populations of at least 1 million. Where an outage lasts\nmore than 12 hours in a 24-hour period, such reimbursements shall be\nat least:\n\n* $500 for spoilage of food and medications,\n\n* $1000 for damages to electrical equipment and instruments, and\n\n* $10,000 to commercial customers for lost business.\n\nThe PSC may also establish reasonable aggregate limits on\nreimbursements.\n\nThe bill provides that additional rounds of reimbursement consistent\nwith the foregoing are required for each additional 4B-hour period\nthat the service interruption continues, and that any voltage\nreductions that are extensive enough to damage electric equipment or\nrender it inoperable shall be treated as covered interruptions in\nservice.\n\nBill &sect;2 adds a new subdivision 13 to &sect;80 of the Public Service Law,\nestablishing provisions for rate refunds or reductions for\nsubstandard service quality, and reimbursement for damages caused by\nservice interruptions, applicable to steam corporations.\n\nBill &sect;3 requires the PSC to report to the Governor and Legislature by\nApril 1, 2010 on whether additional legislation, regulations or other\nactions are needed to ensure that all electric and steam corporations\nadequately reimburse their customers for losses due to service\ninterruptions and other performance failures.\n\nEFFECTS OF PRESENT LAW WHICH THIS BILL WOULD ALTER:\nCurrent law does not provide any standards to ensure prompt,\nmeaningful rate refunds or reductions when an electric utility fails\nto provide safe and adequate service.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIn 2006, the western part of Queens suffered a massive power outage\nthat lasted 9 days. The Assembly Queens power Outage Task Force\nstudied the outage's causes and the inadequate responses by the\ncompany responsible for the transmission and distribution system,\nConsolidated Edison, and by the Public Service Commission. One\nunderlying cause of this debacle was found to be the reliance by New\nYork is utility regulators on antiquated laws, regulations and\npolicies that let companies engaged in energy transmission and\ndistribution operate without effective oversight.\n\nThe Task Force found that current PSC practices fail to incentivize\nutilities to meet their statutory Obligations to provide safe and\nadequate electric service. Findings that a utility has failed to meet\nservice reliability standards result at best in token penalties, and\neven these amounts are routinely amortized or are deferred until a\nsubsequent rate proceeding. As a result, ignoring service quality\ntargets may well make economic sense for the utility.\n\nAfter the bill was initially drafted, a major steam explosion and\nconsequent damage to persons and property demonstrated that similar\nrequirements were needed for steam corporations.\n\nThis bill sets forth a standard - generally, 5% of annual billings\nthat is substantial enough to restore meaningful incentives for\nutilities to take service quality standards seriously. At the same\ntime, the bill provides realistic reimbursement standards for\nutilities serving metropolitan areas in cases where the utility fails\nto maintain the electric grid or steam system in good working\ncondition. In circumstances where electric or steam service is\ninterrupted for large swaths of a metropolitan area, customers should\nnot be expected to bear the brunt of expenses caused by unwise\ndeferrals of maintenance or other utility mismanagement.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nNone.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\n180th day after enactment; provided that the Public Service Commission\nis immediately authorized and directed to promulgate rules and take\nother actions needed to fully implement the bill on such date.\n\n",
