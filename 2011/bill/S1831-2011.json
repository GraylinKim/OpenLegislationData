Is certified by a national certifying or accrediting board for\npolysomnography acceptable to the State Education Department; and\n\nc) has practiced polysomnography under the direction and supervision\nof a licensed physician who specializes in the practice of sleep\nmedicine for not less than three years within the last five. years\nprior to the effective date of this article.\n\n&sect; 8809. Require each licensed polysomnographic technologist to\ncomplete a minimum of twenty-four hours of continuing education\nacceptable to the State Education Department during each triennial\nperiod, with such person not being issued a certificate of\nregistration unless such requirement has. been satisfied. Exemptions\nfrom the continuing education requirement would be provided to\nlicensed polysomnographic technologists in their first triennial\nregistration period and those licensees not engaged in the practice\nof polysomnographic technology, evidenced by a filing statement with\nthe Department. The State Education Department would be authorized to\nissue a one-year, conditional registration to a licensee who fails to\nmeet the mandatory continuing education requirement; provided the\nlicensee agrees to complete any additional education the Department\nmay require and pay t.he triennial registration fee. Licensed\npolysomnographic technologists would be required to maintain adequate\ndocumentation of completion of the continuing education course work\nand provide such documentation upon request of the Department.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nInsufficient or irregular sleep is a growing national\nhealth issue. It is estimated that between 40 and 70 million\nAmericans suffer from sleep disorders and an additional 20 to 30\nmillion people have intermittent sleep-related problems. The human\nand economic costs resulting from sleep deprivation and sleep\ndisorders are staggering with sleep disorders having repeatedly been\nfound to greatly heighten the risk of many serious illnesses\nincluding colon cancer, breast cancer, heart disease, stroke,\ndiabetes, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and obesity. Additionally,\nthere are thousands of deaths and injuries attributable to\nsleep-related vehicular accidents each year, which account for\napproximately twenty percent of all vehicular accidents. The economic\ncost of sleep-related disorders is estimated to be up to $150 billion\nannually in employment absenteeism and lost productivity with an\nadditional $50 billion to $100 billion in indirect costs related to\naccident litigation, destruction of property, medical care, and\ndeath. There are over eighty different classified sleep disorders\nincluding chronic insominia, sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome,\nnarcolepsy, and parasomnias.\nIn addition to the millions of Americans known to suffer from sleep\ndisorders, ninety-five percent of all persons with sleep disorders\nremain undiagnosed because many health care providers are neither\nadequately trained nor informed to diagnose and treat sleep disorders.\n\nGiven the compelling health issues and costs at stake, the diagnosis\nand treatment of sleep disorders has become a vital health care\nissue. In response to this need, there has been an emergence of\n\n\nindependent sleep centers, sleep labs and hospitals using\nstate-of-the-art equipment to monitor test and treat patients\nsuffering from sleep disorders. These facilities rely upon a team of\nprofessionals including physicians specializing in sleep disorders,\nnurses, respiratory therapists, and polysomnographic technologists.\n\nAs the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders has developed,\npolysomnographic technologists have played an integral and, perhaps,\nthe most visible function in patient care including administering\nsleep tests and working with physicians to provide information needed\nfor the accurate diagnosis and treatment of such disorders. They\ntypically are responsible for, gathering and analyzing patient\ninformation and ensuring the appropriate tests are performed,\nadministering tests which may involve connections of electrodes,\nsensors, and air masks, monitoring, scoring and evaluating test\nresults, and ensuring patient safety. Polysomnographic technologists\nare highly trained and often experienced professionals who work under\nthe supervision of, and in cooperation with, physicians and other\nhealth care providers. Importantly, since the diagnosis of a patient\nusually occurs over a one- or two-night period, polysomnographic\ntechnologists are relied upon to work overnight shifts unlike other\nhealth care providers.\n\nBecause polysomnographic technologists provide such a vital service\nwhich often involves, for instance, connecting and monitoring\nbreathing apparatus, the State Education Department (SED) has\nmandated that these technologists demonstrate the appropriate\ntraining and experience through a state licensure and registration\nregulatory scheme. SED has determined that if a legislative solution\ndoes not occur, persons who provide polysomnographic services without\nthe appropriate license could be prosecuted for illegal practice and\nlicensed health care providers who assist in such practice may be\ncharged with professional misconduct. As a result, enactment of this\nbill is essential in the current legislative session to ensure the\ncontinuation of the important work by polysomnographic technologists\nand that state resources are not diminished in enforcing against\nwell-intentioned and qualified health care practitioners.\n\nThis bill Would require the licensure and registration of the\nprofession of polysomnographic technology with an emphasis on\nensuring that polysomnographic technologists practicing in New York\nState. are adequately educated, trained, supervised and regulated for\nthe protection of patients under their care. It would make certain\nthat they are both competent and qualified to work with patients and\nin cooperation With other health care providers, who similarly are\nrequired by law to be qualified and regulated by SED or the State\nHealth Department.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010 Passed Senate\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n None to the state.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect one year after it shall have become\nlaw, provided, however, that effective immediately the\n\n\naddition, amendment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation\nnecessary for the implementation of this act on its effective\ndate is authorized and directed to be made and completed on or\nbefore such effective date; provided further, however, subdivision\n2 of section 8805 of the education law, as added by section one of\nthis act, shall not take effect until such time as there are at\nleast four licensure qualifying associate degree programs,\nacceptable to the department of education, in\npolysomnographic technology operated by accredited colleges and\nuniversities in the state.\n\n",
