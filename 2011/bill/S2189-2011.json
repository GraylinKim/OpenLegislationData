  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2189\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to establishing the crimes of\npossession of an unauthorized recording in the first and second degrees\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo increase the penalties for intellectual\nproperty theft\ninvolving unauthorized recordings.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThis legislation would increase the penalties\nfor intellectual property theft involving unauthorized recordings.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.6279 of 2005-06, Passed Senate\nS.68 of 2007-08, Passed Senate\nS.2368 of 2009-10, Codes\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe counterfeit goods trade is a serious problem which\nis reportedly getting worse. This illicit trade comprises the sale of\nso-called knock-offs of brand-name products as well as pirated\nintellectual property, including \"bootleg\" DVDs. It has been\nestimated that the counterfeit goods trade takes billions of dollars\nout of the state's economy, with an annual fiscal impact of over $2.6\nbillion in lost revenue.\n\nUnder current law, the \"unauthorized operation of a recording device\nin a motion picture theater\" is prohibited: it is a violation under\npenal law section 275.32. This legislation would allow for\nprosecutions for possession of recordings made in violation of that\nsection; possession of more than ten (10) such recordings would be a\nclass E felony.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThe first day of November next succeeding the date on\nwhich it shall have become a law.\n\n",
