  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2473\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the alcoholic beverage control law, in relation to the shipment\nof alcoholic beverages into the state\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo require that alcoholic beverages imported into New York be first\ndelivered to a licensed New York State wholesaler and maintained at a\npremises or warehouse operated by such wholesaler for a period of 48\nhours (i.e., \"at-rest\") if the out-of-state shipment emanates from a\nstate which also has an \"at-rest\" statutory requirement.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 amends paragraphs (al and (b) of subdivision 1 of section\n102 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, as amended by chapter 210\nof the laws of 2005, to require that, in certain circumstances,\nalcoholic beverages shipped into the State from out-of-state\nlocations be shipped to a licensed New York wholesaler and maintained\nat a premises or warehouse operated by such wholesaler.\n\nSection 2 of the bill provides an effective date of January 1 next\nsucceeding the date the bill becomes law.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nSection 511 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law covers various means in\nwhich persons may be guilty of aggravated unlicensed operation in the\nsecond degree. This legislation expands upon the circumstances of\naggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle, which is a\nmisdemeanor.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nUnder current New York Law, out-of-state alcoholic shipments can be\nmade by out of state wholesalers directly to New York retailers,\ndespite the fact that many states outside of New York prohibit such\ndirect shipments to retail licensees in their respective states. In\nfact, many of the states surrounding New York (e.g. New Jersey,\nConnecticut) have laws which require that alcohol shipped into the\nstate from out-of-state suppliers be shipped to a licensed wholesaler\nwithin the state and maintained at a premises operated by such\nwholesaler for a minimum period of time _ commonly referred to as\n\"at-rest\" laws. This requirement from states bordering New York,\nclearly puts New York businesses who wish to ship to neighboring\nstates at a competitive disadvantage. This legislation simply\nestablishes a reciprocal \"at-rest\" provision of law (i.e., one that\napplies to shipments which come from states that have existing\n\"at-rest\" laws).\n\nUnlike out-of-state shippers who can deliver alcohol directly to New\nYork retailers, New York distributors are not afforded the same\n\nluxury in many states, denying them the same competitive\nopportunities as their foreign competitors. This legislation \"levels\nthe playing field\" between New York businesses and out of state\nbusinesses whose state requires the warehousing of alcoholic\nbeverages delivered from New York. Moreover, requiring the shipment\nof alcoholic beverages to be \"at-rest\" in New York, facilitates the\neffective collection of New York's taxes on alcoholic beverages.\nCurrently, the collection of excise taxes (paid by wholesalers) is\nmore difficult when the alcohol is shipped from out of state. At a\ntime when the state's economy is revitalizing, New York should seek\nto capitalize on opportunities which ensure that tax revenues are\ncollected. Finally, this legislation has the ancillary benefit of\nbusiness growth in New York as out of state distributors are required\nto ware house alcoholic beverages in New York. To the extent such\nstorage facilities do not currently exist, the construction of\nfacilities will need to take place.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.6382 of 2006; Referred to Investigations & Government Operations\nS.1300 of 2007-2008\nA.5077 of 2009-10\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nIncreased tax revenues for the State.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThe first of January next succeeding the date the bill becomes law.\n\n",
