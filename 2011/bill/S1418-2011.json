  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1418\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the correction law, in relation to permissible employment,\nemployment related activities, and volunteer activities that may be\nperformed by convicted sex offenders\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill amends certain sections of the correction law with\nrespect to the employment of convicted sex offenders.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 amends the Correction Law by prohibiting convicted sex\noffenders from working or volunteering at any facility where such\nemployment would allow the offender unsupervised access to\nresidential living quarters.\nSection 2 establishes an immediate effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe enactment of the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) (Correction\nLaw Article 6-C) in 1996 established a system within which to\nprotect our communities by requiring sex offenders to register with\nthe State, and to make public information about offenders living in\nour neighborhoods. Armed with this information, our communities are\nable to shield the most vulnerable of citizens. While current law\nprovides comprehensive residential prohibitions, it lacks similar\nemployment restrictions. The law goes to great lengths to restrict\nconvicted sex offenders from living in our neighborhoods, yet allows\nconvicted offenders to work in our homes without our knowledge or\nsupervision.\n\nThis loophole was recently highlighted in the news when it was\ndiscovered that a Level-3 sex offender was employed as a\nsuperintendent in a residential building in Manhattan. Employment as\na building superintendent allowed this convicted offender to possess\nkeys to individual apartments. Permitting convicted sex offenders\nsuch unsupervised access is dangerous, and counter-intuitive. Most\nshocking about this unfettered access to residences, is that the\nexisting law does not prohibit convicted sex offenders from obtaining\nsuch employment.\n\nAmending Section 168-v of the Correction Law expands and enhances the\nprotections established by the Sex Offender Registration Act. This\namendment is not intended to bar one's ability to secure a\nlivelihood, but to exclude from permissible employment those\npositions in which convicted sex offenders have unsupervised access\nto residences. Requiring direct supervision of any convicted sex\noffender employee, or volunteer, who has access to residential living\nquarters is not only prudent, but necessary to protect our most\nvulnerable citizens.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010: S.6857 - Crime Victims, Crime and Correction\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
