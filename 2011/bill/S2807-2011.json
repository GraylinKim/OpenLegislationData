In the event that such policy is\n   19  issued by an insurance company other than  the  state  fund,  then  said\n   20  policy  shall  be  deemed  of the kind specified in paragraph fifteen of\n   21  subsection (a) of section one  thousand  one  hundred  thirteen  of  the\n   22  insurance  law and covered by the workers' compensation security fund as\n   23  created and governed by article six-A of this chapter. It shall only  be\n   24  issued  for a single complete premium payment in advance by the employer\n   25  OR GROUP OF EMPLOYERS and in an amount deemed acceptable  by  the  chair\n   26  and  the  superintendent of insurance. In lieu of the applicable premium\n   27  charge ordinarily required to be imposed  by  a  carrier,  said  premium\n   28  shall include a surcharge in an amount to be determined by the chair to:\n   29  (i)  satisfy  all assessment liability due and owing to the board and/or\n   30  the chair under this chapter; and (ii)  satisfy  all  future  assessment\n   31  liability  under  this  section.  Said surcharge shall be payable to the\n   32  board simultaneous to  the  execution  of  the  assumption  of  workers'\n   33  compensation  liability  insurance  policy. However, the payment of said\n   34  surcharge does not relieve the carrier from any other liability, includ-\n   35  ing liability owed to the superintendent of insurance pursuant to  arti-\n   36  cle  [six-a]  SIX-A  of this chapter.   When issued such policy shall be\n   37  non-cancellable without recourse for any cause during the continuance of\n   38  the liability secured and so covered.\n   39    [The board will report to the  governor  and  the  legislature  on  or\n   40  before  December  first,  two thousand seven, as to the advisability and\n   41  feasibility of (1) implementing a statewide self-insured  employer  bond\n   42  program, and (2) an improved individual employer bond program.]\n   43    S  3.  Paragraph  9  of  subdivision 3-a of section 50 of the workers'\n   44  compensation law is REPEALED and paragraph 2  and  subparagraph  (a)  of\n   45  paragraph  7, paragraph 2 as amended by chapter 139 of the laws of 2008,\n   46  and subparagraph (a) of paragraph 7 as amended by section 4 of part R of\n   47  chapter 56 of the laws of 2010, are amended and three new paragraphs 10,\n   48  11 and 12 are added to read as follows:\n   49    (2) (a) Any group consisting exclusively of such employers may adopt a\n   50  plan for self-insurance, as a group, for  the  payment  of  compensation\n   51  under  this  chapter  to  their employees, except that no new groups may\n   52  adopt such a plan [prior to April first,  two  thousand  nine],  AND  NO\n   53  GROUP NOT COMPOSED SOLELY OF PUBLIC ENTITIES SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH A OF\n   54  SUBDIVISION  FOUR  OF  THIS  SECTION  MAY INSURE ANY LIABILITIES FOR ANY\n   55  EMPLOYERS ON AND AFTER JANUARY FIRST, TWO  THOUSAND  TWELVE,  EXCEPT  AS\n   56  PROVIDED  FOR  IN PARAGRAPH TEN OF THIS SUBDIVISION. Under such plan the\n\n       S. 2807                            17                            A. 4007\n\n    1  group shall assume the liability of all the employers within  the  group\n    2  and  pay  all compensation for which the said employers are liable under\n    3  this chapter, except that in the case of municipal corporations as here-\n    4  in  defined  no  proof  of financial ability or deposit of securities or\n    5  cash need be made in compliance with this subdivision.  The group quali-\n    6  fying under this subdivision shall be known as a group self-insurer  and\n    7  the  employers  participating therein and covered thereby shall be known\n    8  as members.\n    9    (b) Where such plan is adopted the group  self-insurer  shall  furnish\n   10  satisfactory  proof  to  the  chair of its financial ability to pay such\n   11  compensation for the members in the industry covered by it,  its  reven-\n   12  ues,  their source and assurance of continuance. The chair shall require\n   13  the deposit with the chair of such securities as may be deemed necessary\n   14  of the kind prescribed in subdivisions one, two, three, four  and  five,\n   15  and  subparagraph (a) of paragraph three of subdivision seven of section\n   16  two hundred thirty-five of the banking law or the deposit of cash or the\n   17  filing of irrevocable letters of credit issued by  a  qualified  banking\n   18  institution  as  defined by rules promulgated by the chair or the filing\n   19  of a bond of a surety company authorized to transact  business  in  this\n   20  state,  in an amount to be determined to secure its liability to pay the\n   21  compensation of each employer as above provided.  Such surety bond  must\n   22  be  approved as to form by the chair. The chair shall require each group\n   23  self-insurer to provide regular reports no  less  than  annually,  which\n   24  shall  include but not be limited to audited financial statements, actu-\n   25  arial opinions and payroll information containing proof that it is fully\n   26  funded. Such reports shall also include  a  contribution  year  analysis\n   27  detailing  contributions  and  expenses  associated  with  each specific\n   28  contribution year. For purposes of this paragraph, proof  that  a  group\n   29  self-insurer  is  fully funded shall at a minimum include proof of unre-\n   30  stricted cash and investments permitted by regulation of the chair of at\n   31  least one hundred percent of the total liabilities, including the  esti-\n   32  mate  presented in the actuarial opinion submitted by the group self-in-\n   33  surer in accordance with this chapter. The chair by regulation, may  set\n   34  further  financial standards for group self-insurers. Any group self-in-\n   35  surer that fails to show that it is fully funded shall be deemed  under-\n   36  funded,  and  must submit a plan for achieving fully funded status which\n   37  may include a deficit assessment on members of such  group  self-insurer\n   38  which  shall  be  subject to approval or modification by the chair. [The\n   39  chair may impose such limitations on admission of new members or  offer-\n   40  ing  of discounts on underfunded group self-insurers to insure that such\n   41  group self-insurers shall become fully funded. Should the group self-in-\n   42  surer fail to meet the terms of its plan, the chair  may  condition  its\n   43  continued  authorization  to act as a group self-insurer on the appoint-\n   44  ment of an outside monitor selected by the chair,  at  the  group  self-\n   45  insurer's  expense.  Effective January first, two thousand fourteen, any\n   46  group self-insurer that fails to show it is fully funded  in  accordance\n   47  with  this  paragraph  and the regulations issued pursuant thereto shall\n   48  have one year to cure the deficiency. If such deficiency  is  not  cured\n   49  within  one  year,  the  group self-insurer shall be given six months to\n   50  terminate its coverage.]\n   51    (c) The chair shall evaluate, no less than once every three  years,  a\n   52  group  self-insurer's  compliance  with  the  financial  and  regulatory\n   53  requirements for self-insurance. The  chair  may  engage  any  qualified\n   54  person  or  organization  to  assist  with such evaluation and any costs\n   55  incurred by the chair shall be borne by  the  group  self-insurer  under\n   56  examination.

All  actuaries  so  selected\n    8  shall be fellows or associates of the casualty actuarial society.\n    9    (e)  The chair may also require that any and all agreements, contracts\n   10  and other pertinent  documents  relating  to  the  organization  of  the\n   11  members in the group self-insurer shall be filed [at the time the appli-\n   12  cation  for  group  self-insurance  is  made or anytime thereafter. Such\n   13  application shall be on a form prescribed by the chair.  The  chair  may\n   14  also  require an agreement on the part of said group self-insurer to pay\n   15  any awards commuted under section twenty-seven of this chapter into  the\n   16  aggregate trust fund as a condition of its being allowed to operate as a\n   17  group self-insurer pursuant to this subdivision] WITH THE CHAIR.\n   18    (f) The chair shall have the authority to [deny the application of the\n   19  group  self-insurer  to  pay  such  compensation  or  to] revoke consent\n   20  furnished under this section at any time for good cause shown.\n   21    (g) At least twenty days prior to the requested effective date of  the\n   22  participating  agreement, a group self-insurer shall notify the chair on\n   23  a prescribed form of a new group self-insurer  member  and  file  (1)  a\n   24  member  application  and  (2) a copy of the properly executed prescribed\n   25  participation agreement wherein the member acknowledges their joint  and\n   26  several obligation for their period of membership. The board shall, on a\n   27  form promulgated by the chair, provide notice of the member's rights and\n   28  responsibilities  as a group self-insurer member, including the member's\n   29  assumption of joint and several liability, and  require  the  member  to\n   30  return  a  signed  copy  to the chair as a condition of membership. Such\n   31  membership shall not become effective until the  signed  copy  has  been\n   32  received by the board.\n   33    (h)  Any  member  terminating membership in a group self-insurer after\n   34  less than four years in such group self-insurer, and  any  member  in  a\n   35  group self-insurer that has defaulted, shall be precluded from obtaining\n   36  prospective  coverage  from  any  group  self-insurer for a period of at\n   37  least three years from the effective date of termination.\n   38    (a) If for any reason, the status of a group self-insurer  under  this\n   39  subdivision  is  terminated,  INCLUDING BY OPERATION OF LAW ON AND AFTER\n   40  JANUARY FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWELVE, the securities or cash or the surety\n   41  bond on deposit referred to herein shall remain in the  custody  of  the\n   42  chair  for such time as the chair may deem proper and warranted. In lieu\n   43  thereof, and at the discretion of the chair, the group self-insurer, its\n   44  heirs or assigns or others carrying on or liquidating such  group  self-\n   45  insurer,  including  the  chair  on the group self-insurer's behalf, may\n   46  execute an assumption of workers' compensation liability insurance poli-\n   47  cy securing such further and future contingent liability  as  may  arise\n   48  from  prior  injuries to workers and be incurred by reason of any change\n   49  in the condition of such workers warranting the board making  subsequent\n   50  awards for payment of additional compensation. Such policy shall be in a\n   51  form approved by the superintendent of insurance and issued by the state\n   52  fund  or any insurance company licensed to issue this class of insurance\n   53  in this state.  In the event that such policy is issued by an  insurance\n   54  company  other  than the state fund, then said policy shall be deemed of\n   55  the kind specified in paragraph fifteen of subsection (a) of section one\n   56  thousand one hundred thirteen of the insurance law and  covered  by  the\n\n       S. 2807                            19                            A. 4007\n\n    1  workers'  compensation  security fund as created and governed by article\n    2  six-A of this chapter.  It shall only be issued for  a  single  complete\n    3  premium  payment  in  advance by the group self-insurer and in an amount\n    4  deemed  acceptable  by the chair and the superintendent of insurance. In\n    5  lieu of the applicable premium charge ordinarily required to be  imposed\n    6  by  a carrier, said premium shall include a surcharge in an amount to be\n    7  determined by the chair to: (i) satisfy all assessment liability due and\n    8  owing to the board and/or the chair under this chapter; and (ii) satisfy\n    9  all future assessment liability under this section. Said surcharge shall\n   10  be payable to the board simultaneous to the execution of the  assumption\n   11  of  workers'  compensation  liability  insurance  policy.  However,  the\n   12  payment of said surcharge does not relieve the carrier  from  any  other\n   13  liability,  including  liability owed to the superintendent of insurance\n   14  pursuant to article six-A of this chapter.    When  issued  such  policy\n   15  shall  be  noncancellable  without  recourse  for  any  cause during the\n   16  continuance of the liability secured and so covered.\n   17    (10) (A) A NON-MUNICIPAL GROUP OF EMPLOYERS MAY  MAKE  APPLICATION  TO\n   18  THE CHAIR TO QUALIFY JOINTLY AS A SELF-INSURER, PROVIDED:\n   19    (1)  THE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP SECURE THE SERVICES OF AN ADMINISTRATOR,\n   20  WHO SHALL CARRY OUT THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF SUCH AN ADMINISTRATOR AS SET\n   21  FORTH IN SUBDIVISION FIVE OF THIS SECTION, AND WHO SHALL BE  SUBJECT  TO\n   22  THE RESTRICTIONS AND PENALTIES APPLICABLE TO AN ADMINISTRATOR UNDER THIS\n   23  SECTION;\n   24    (2)  THE  MEMBERS  OF  THE  GROUP,  THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATOR, JOINTLY\n   25  DEPOSIT SUFFICIENT SECURITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH  SUBDIVISION  THREE  OF\n   26  THIS  SECTION  AS TO SECURE THE LIABILITY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP TO\n   27  PAY COMPENSATION, PROVIDED THE INITIAL DEPOSIT SHALL BE MADE BY NOVEMBER\n   28  FIRST, TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN;\n   29    (3) THE GROUP HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED  BY  THE  CHAIR  TO  SELF-INSURE  IN\n   30  ACCORDANCE  WITH  THIS  SUBDIVISION  PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS\n   31  PARAGRAPH;\n   32    (4) THE GROUP'S MEMBERS FALL WITHIN A LIMITED NUMBER OF PAYROLL  CLAS-\n   33  SIFICATIONS,  AS SET BY THE CHAIR, AFTER GIVING DUE CONSIDERATION TO THE\n   34  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH  ANY  GROUP  OF  EMPLOYERS  SELF-INSURING  OR  THE\n   35  PARTICIPANT  EMPLOYERS  ARE  PARTIES  TO  THE SAME COLLECTIVE BARGAINING\n   36  AGREEMENT;\n   37    (5) THE GROUP WAS FULLY FUNDED FOR  FOUR  OUT  OF  THE  PREVIOUS  FIVE\n   38  YEARS,  AS DETERMINED BY THE CHAIR FOLLOWING A FINANCIAL REVIEW, AND THE\n   39  GROUP SELF-INSURER HAS SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO MEET ITS LIABILITIES;\n   40    (6) THE GROUP HAS A SAFETY PROGRAM ACCEPTABLE TO THE CHAIR; AND\n   41    (7) THE GROUP IS SUBJECT TO SUCH OTHER LIMITATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS OF\n   42  THIS SUBDIVISION UNLESS WAIVED BY THE CHAIR AND TO  REGULATIONS  OF  THE\n   43  CHAIR.\n   44    (B)  THE MEMBERS OF ANY SUCH GROUP SHALL ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT AMONG\n   45  THEMSELVES AND WITH THE GROUP'S ADMINISTRATOR WHICH SHALL, AT A MINIMUM:\n   46    (1) INDICATE THAT EACH OF THE MEMBERS OF  THE  GROUP  IS  JOINTLY  AND\n   47  SEVERALLY LIABLE FOR ANY LIABILITIES OF THE GROUP; AND\n   48    (2)  PROVIDE FOR THE COLLECTION OF ADDITIONAL FUNDS FROM GROUP MEMBERS\n   49  IN THE EVENT THE DEPOSIT WITH THE BOARD  IS  INSUFFICIENT  TO  MEET  THE\n   50  LIABILITIES OF THE GROUP.\n   51    (11) FORMER GROUP SELF-INSURER.

Subparagraph 2 of paragraph b of subdivision 5 of section 50 of\n    9  the workers' compensation law is REPEALED.\n   10    S 5. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 4 of section 141-a of  the  workers'\n   11  compensation  law, as added by chapter 6 of the laws of 2007, is amended\n   12  to read as follows:\n   13    (a) Whenever the chair determines that an employer who is required  to\n   14  secure compensation in accordance with this chapter has failed to secure\n   15  such  compensation,  or  where  an  employer has failed to pay penalties\n   16  assessed against it pursuant to this chapter, OR FAILED TO PAY  A  JUDG-\n   17  MENT  UNDER  SECTION TWENTY-SIX OF THIS CHAPTER WITHIN NINETY DAYS AFTER\n   18  NOTICE TO THE EMPLOYER AND HAS NOT MOVED TO MODIFY OR VACATE SUCH  JUDG-\n   19  MENT, such failure shall be deemed an immediate serious danger to public\n   20  health, safety, or welfare sufficient to justify service by the chair of\n   21  a  stop-work order on the employer, requiring the cessation of all busi-\n   22  ness operations effective immediately, except where the employer's fail-\n   23  ure concerns only domestic or child care  workers  in  his  or  her  own\n   24  household. The chair may issue such order, which shall take effect as to\n   25  a  particular  employer  worksite when served at that worksite, or as to\n   26  all employer worksites in the state for which the  employer  is  not  in\n   27  compliance  when served on the employer. A stop-work order may be served\n   28  with regard to an employer's worksite by posting a copy of the stop-work\n   29  order in a conspicuous location at the worksite. The order shall  remain\n   30  in  effect  until the chair directs that the stop-work order be removed,\n   31  upon a determination that the employer has come into compliance with the\n   32  coverage requirements of this chapter and has paid any penalty  assessed\n   33  under  this  chapter.  If  the  employer  shall within thirty days after\n   34  notice of the stop-work order make an application in affidavit form  for\n   35  a  redetermination  review of such order the chair shall make a decision\n   36  in writing on the issues raised  in  such  application.  The  chair  may\n   37  direct  a conditional release from a stop-work order upon a finding that\n   38  the employer has complied with coverage requirements of this chapter and\n   39  has agreed to remit periodic payments  of  the  penalty  pursuant  to  a\n   40  payment  agreement  schedule with the chair. If an agreement or order of\n   41  conditional release is issued, failure by the employer to meet any  term\n   42  or  condition  of  such  payment agreement shall result in the immediate\n   43  reinstatement of the stop-work order and the entire  unpaid  balance  of\n   44  the  penalty  shall  become  immediately  due.  The chair may require an\n   45  employer who is found  to  have  failed  to  comply  with  the  coverage\n   46  requirements  of  this chapter to file with the board, as a condition of\n   47  release from a stop-work order,  periodic  reports  for  a  probationary\n   48  period that shall not exceed two years, and that demonstrate the employ-\n   49  er's  continued  compliance  with  this chapter. The board shall by rule\n   50  specify the reports required and the time for filing under this subdivi-\n   51  sion.\n   52    S 6. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of subdivision 2 of  section  151  of  the\n   53  workers' compensation law, paragraph (b) as amended by section 2 of part\n   54  QQ  of  chapter  56  of the laws of 2009 and paragraph (c) as amended by\n   55  chapter 6 of the laws of 2007, are amended to read as follows:\n\n       S. 2807                            21                            A. 4007\n\n    1    (b) An itemized statement of the expenses so ascertained shall be open\n    2  to public inspection in the office of the board for  thirty  days  after\n    3  notice to the state insurance fund, all insurance carriers and all self-\n    4  insurers  [including  group  self-insurers] affected thereby, before the\n    5  board shall make an assessment for such expenses. The chair shall assess\n    6  upon  and  collect a proportion of such expenses as hereinafter provided\n    7  from each insurance carrier, the state insurance fund and each  self-in-\n    8  surer  [including group self-insurers]. The assessment for such expenses\n    9  shall be allocated to (i) self-insurers [except group self-insurers] and\n   10  the state insurance fund  based  upon  the  proportion  that  the  total\n   11  compensation  payments  made by all self-insurers [except group self-in-\n   12  surers] and the state insurance fund in such  year  bore  to  the  total\n   13  compensation  payments  made by all self-insurers [except group self-in-\n   14  surers], the state insurance fund, AND all insurance carriers [and group\n   15  self-insurers] and (ii) insurance carriers  based  upon  the  proportion\n   16  that  the  total compensation payments made by all insurance carriers in\n   17  such year bore to the total compensation payments by all  self-insurers,\n   18  the  state  insurance  fund and all insurance carriers[, and (iii) group\n   19  self-insurers based upon the  proportion  that  the  total  compensation\n   20  payments  made by all group self-insurers in such year bore to the total\n   21  compensation payments made by all  self-insurers,  the  state  insurance\n   22  fund and all insurance carriers]. The portion of the assessment for such\n   23  expenses allocated to self-insurers [except group self-insurers] and the\n   24  state  insurance  fund  that  shall  be collected from each self-insurer\n   25  [except group self-insurers] and the state insurance fund shall be a sum\n   26  equal to the proportion of  the  amount  which  the  total  compensation\n   27  payments  of each such self-insurer [except a group self-insurer] or the\n   28  state insurance fund  in  such  year  bore  to  the  total  compensation\n   29  payments  made by all self-insurers [except group self-insurers] and the\n   30  state insurance fund.
