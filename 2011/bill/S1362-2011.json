  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1362\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the vehicle and traffic law, in relation to extending the\nmaximum length of vehicles\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nTo extend the maximum length of\nvehicles to allow some specialized maintenance vehicles the ability\nto operate without penalty.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIn 2003 New York State authorized recreational vehicles\n(RV's) up to 45 feet in length to travel on highways to aid tourism\nin the state. However, the law neglected to include professional\nvehicles that perform routine and important tasks throughout the\nstate. Many citizens depend on the service abilities of these\nvehicles, which extend past the current allowable length to allow for\nincreased safety and equipment. The current law is out of step with\nthe needs of its citizenry. If untrained recreational drivers are\nable to legally navigate on state roads, then professionals should be\nallowed the same allowance.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n 2010 - S.7970/A.11189\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the thirtieth day after\nit shall have become law.\n\n",
