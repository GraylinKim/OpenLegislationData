Legislative  findings.  The  legislature hereby finds and\n   20  declares that the current regulatory environment in New York state has a\n   21  significant impact on the state's businesses, economy and global econom-\n   22  ic competitiveness. In order to provide New York businesses the opportu-\n   23  nity for growth and the ability to compete,  along  with  providing  the\n   24  citizens  of  this  state the ability to find gainful employment and the\n   25  benefits of a strong economy, New York state must provide  a  regulatory\n   26  environment  that  reduces  the  cost  of  doing  business in the state,\n   27  promotes business growth and encourages job creation.\n   28    The legislature further finds that it is in the interest of the  state\n   29  to  undertake  at  this time a rational, independent review of all regu-\n   30  lations that impact the business environment of this state which stifles\n   31  the potential of New York's workers and businesses. In order  to  under-\n   32  take  such  review  rationally and equitably, the legislature determines\n   33  that it is necessary to establish a commission separate and  apart  from\n   34  existing bodies responsible for promulgating rules and regulations which\n   35  affect  the business environment, to review all existing rules and regu-\n   36  lations and to provide continued oversight on future proposed rules  and\n   37  regulations  in  an  effort to cut waste, reduce paperwork and create an\n   38  efficient and cost effective environment for doing business in New York.\n   39    S 2.
