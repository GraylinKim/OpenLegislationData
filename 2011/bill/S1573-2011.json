  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1573\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the education law, in relation to authorizing boards of\ncooperative educational services to enter into contracts with public\nlibraries for high-speed telecommunications services\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo grant to any Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES), the\nability to enter into contracts with public or association libraries\nor library systems to provide telecommunications services.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 amends paragraph h of subdivision 4 of section 1950 of\neducation law by adding a new subparagraph 8 which grants to boards\nof cooperative educational services (BOCES) the ability to enter into\ncontracts with public or association libraries or library systems to\nprovide telecommunications services.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nCurrently BOCES are not authorized to enter into these types of\ncontracts.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nMany BOCES have invested significant sums of money in developing their\nown telecommunications networks including high-speed Internet\nservice. Public libraries, throughout the State have a similar need\nto access telecommunication services including high speed Internet\nservices, but have not been able to invest the money needed to create\ntheir own systems. This measure would allow libraries to access\nalready established telecommunication services and to share the costs\nof maintaining such a system at a reduced cost for both parties in\nthe contract.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.4634-A/A.8673-A of 2009-2010 - Passed Senate\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nEffective 120 days after it has become law.\n\n",
