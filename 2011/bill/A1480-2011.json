ROSENTHAL -- Multi-Sponsored by -- M. of A. HOOP-\n         ER -- read once and referred to the Committee on Education\n\n       AN  ACT  to  amend  the education law, in relation to training of school\n         athletic coaches in the recognition and management of head injuries\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Legislative intent. Concussions are one of the most common-\n    2  ly  reported  injuries  in  children  and adolescents who participate in\n    3  sports and recreational activities.  The centers for disease control and\n    4  prevention estimates that as many as three million nine hundred thousand\n    5  sports-related and recreation-related concussions occur  in  the  United\n    6  States each year.\n    7    A  concussion  is  a  type of brain injury that can range from mild to\n    8  severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally works. It is caused by\n    9  a blow or motion to the head or body  that  causes  the  brain  to  move\n   10  rapidly  inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or death is\n   11  significant when a concussion or head injury is not  properly  evaluated\n   12  and managed.\n   13    Concussions  can occur in any organized or unorganized sport or recre-\n   14  ational activity and can result from a fall or  from  players  colliding\n   15  with  each  other, the ground, or with obstacles. Concussions occur with\n   16  or without loss of consciousness, but the vast majority  occurs  without\n   17  loss of consciousness.\n   18    Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of head injury leaves\n   19  the  young  athlete  especially  vulnerable  to  greater injury and even\n   20  death.  Despite some increased recognition about the importance of diag-\n   21  nosing and treating concussions, some affected youth athletes are prema-\n   22  turely returned to play, which can have  harmful  and  potentially  even\n   23  deadly  results.    It  is  therefore imperative that adults supervising\n   24  young athletes in school settings receive proper training  to  recognize\n   25  and  evaluate  concussions and other traumatic sport-related injuries in\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD01468-01-1\n\n       A. 1480                             2\n\n    1  order to ensure the safety of New York's children who compete in school-\n    2  related sports activities.\n    3    S  2.
