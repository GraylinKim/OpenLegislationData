  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2242\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the election law, in relation to criminal penalties\nfor election misconduct\n\nPURPOSE:\nEnhances criminal enforcement by conforming the fines imposed under\nthe election law to those imposed for comparable crimes under the\npenal law and clarifying that all instances of false witnessing of\npetitions are misdemeanors under the election law.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection one adds clarifying language to subdivision two of &sect; 14-126 by\ncross-referencing to elsewhere in that section wherein evasion of\ncontribution limits through unauthorized committees or expenditures\nis a felony, rather than a misdemeanor. section two expands\nsubdivision seven of &sect; 17-132 to prohibit false witnessing of\npetitions not only by subscribing witnesses but also by notaries\npublic and commissioners of deeds. Section three replaces the\nspecific penalty provisions in &sect;17-166 for first time misdemeanors\nwith a statement that, in accordance with &sect; 55.10 of the penal law,\nsuch crimes are class A misdemeanors. Consequently, the penalty\nprovisions in the penal law would govern. conforming language\nrelating to felonies is also added without any substantive change. In\naddition, the repeat offender language is amended so that it applies\nnot only to a person convicted of a second misdemeanor, but also to a\nperson convicted of a misdemeanor after being convicted of a felony.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nBy expanding the crime of false witnessing to notaries public and\ncommissioners of deed, this bill clearly establishes the State\nBoard's jurisdiction to investigate such matters. Currently,\n17-132(7) establishes that false witnessing by a subscribing witness\nto a petition is a misdemeanor, but makes no reference to notaries\npublic and commissioners of deeds who are also authorized to witness\npetitions. While false witnessing by a commissioner of deeds may be\nconstrued to be prohibited by &sect; 135-a of the Executive Law, which\nprohibits fraud or deceit, the State Board's jurisdiction is limited\nto alleged violations of the election law. It is unlikely that the\nLegislature intended the State Board to investigate only those false\nwitnessing cases involving subscribing witnesses and therefore this\nbill would correct that oversight.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately, with provisions.\n\n",
