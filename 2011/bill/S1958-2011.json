KRUGER -- read twice and ordered printed, and when\n         printed to be committed to the Committee on Consumer Protection\n\n       AN ACT to amend the general business law, in relation to the  regulation\n         of  unsolicited  advertisements  and  the  sale, rental or exchange of\n         personal information\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section  1.  Legislative  findings  and declaration.   The legislature\n    2  hereby finds and declares that the use  of  computers,  data  bases  and\n    3  information sharing threaten the privacy of our citizens. Personal iden-\n    4  tification information is compiled and transferred without the knowledge\n    5  and consent of the data subject.  In many situations, personal identifi-\n    6  cation  information  is  being  used  for  secondary  purposes, purposes\n    7  different from the one for which the information was originally given or\n    8  obtained.  Improper collection and dissemination of personal identifica-\n    9  tion information not only infringes upon individual privacy but also has\n   10  increased the ability of unethical persons to engage in fraud and theft.\n   11  In addition, collection and  dissemination  of  personal  identification\n   12  information  can  threaten  the security of those who wish to keep their\n   13  addresses and other information secret. For these reasons, the  legisla-\n   14  ture  proposes  this  statute  to  provide a means by which citizens can\n   15  protect their personal identification information.\n   16    S 2. The general business law is amended by adding  two  new  sections\n   17  394-f and 394-g to read as follows:\n   18    S  394-F.  UNSOLICITED ADVERTISEMENTS. 1.
