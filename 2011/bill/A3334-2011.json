ABINANTI, GALEF, JACOBS, McENENY, SWEENEY -- read once and\n         referred to the Committee on Higher Education\n\n       AN   ACT   to  amend  the  education  law,  in  relation  to  electronic\n         prescriptions and generic substitution\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section  1.  Section  6802 of the education law is amended by adding a\n    2  new subdivision 23 to read as follows:\n    3    23. \"ELECTRONIC PRESCRIPTION\" MEANS A PRESCRIPTION CREATED,  RECORDED,\n    4  OR  STORED BY ELECTRONIC MEANS; ISSUED WITH AN ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE; AND\n    5  TRANSMITTED BY ELECTRONIC MEANS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATIONS  OF  THE\n    6  COMMISSIONER  AND  APPLICABLE  REGULATIONS OF THE COMMISSIONER OF HEALTH\n    7  AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT AN ORIGINAL  HARD  COPY\n    8  PRESCRIPTION  THAT  IS CREATED ELECTRONICALLY OR OTHERWISE MAY BE TRANS-\n    9  MITTED FROM THE PRESCRIBER TO THE PHARMACIST BY FACSIMILE  AND  MUST  BE\n   10  MANUALLY  SIGNED. \"ELECTRONIC\" MEANS OF OR RELATING TO TECHNOLOGY HAVING\n   11  ELECTRICAL, DIGITAL, MAGNETIC, WIRELESS,  OPTICAL,  ELECTROMAGNETIC,  OR\n   12  SIMILAR  CAPABILITIES. \"ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE\" MEANS AN ELECTRONIC SOUND,\n   13  SYMBOL, OR PROCESS, ATTACHED TO OR LOGICALLY ASSOCIATED  WITH  AN  ELEC-\n   14  TRONIC  PRESCRIPTION AND EXECUTED OR ADOPTED BY A PERSON WITH THE INTENT\n   15  TO SIGN THE PRESCRIPTION, IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATIONS OF THE  COMMIS-\n   16  SIONER  AND  APPLICABLE  REGULATIONS  OF  THE COMMISSIONER OF HEALTH AND\n   17  FEDERAL REGULATIONS.\n   18    S 2. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 6 of section 6810 of  the  education\n   19  law,  as  amended by chapter 649 of the laws of 1993, is amended to read\n   20  as follows:\n   21    (a) Every prescription written in this state by a person authorized to\n   22  issue such prescription shall be on prescription  forms  containing  one\n   23  line  for  the  prescriber's signature. The prescriber's signature shall\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD05379-01-1\n\n       A. 3334                             2\n\n    1  validate the prescription. EVERY ELECTRONIC PRESCRIPTION  SHALL  PROVIDE\n    2  FOR  THE  PRESCRIBER'S  ELECTRONIC  SIGNATURE,  WHICH SHALL VALIDATE THE\n    3  ELECTRONIC PRESCRIPTION. Imprinted conspicuously ON  EVERY  PRESCRIPTION\n    4  WRITTEN  IN  THIS STATE in eight point upper case type immediately below\n    5  the signature line shall be the words: \"THIS PRESCRIPTION WILL BE FILLED\n    6  GENERICALLY UNLESS PRESCRIBER WRITES 'd a w' IN THE BOX  BELOW\".  Unless\n    7  the  prescriber  writes  d a w in such box in the prescriber's own hand-\n    8  writing OR, IN THE CASE OF ELECTRONIC PRESCRIPTIONS,  INSERTS  AN  ELEC-\n    9  TRONIC  DIRECTION  TO  DISPENSE  THE  DRUG  AS WRITTEN, the prescriber's\n   10  signature OR ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE shall designate  approval  of  substi-\n   11  tution  by  a  pharmacist of a drug product pursuant to paragraph (o) of\n   12  subdivision one of section two hundred six of the public health law.  No\n   13  other  letters  or  marks  in  such  box shall prohibit substitution. No\n   14  prescription forms used or intended to be used by a person authorized to\n   15  issue a prescription shall have 'd a w' preprinted in such box. Such box\n   16  shall be placed directly under the signature line and  shall  be  three-\n   17  quarters  inch  in  length and one-half inch in height, OR IN COMPARABLE\n   18  FORM FOR AN ELECTRONIC PRESCRIPTION AS MAY BE SPECIFIED BY REGULATION OF\n   19  THE COMMISSIONER.  Immediately below such box shall be imprinted in  six\n   20  point  type  the  words \"Dispense As Written\". Notwithstanding any other\n   21  provision of law, no state official, agency, board or other entity shall\n   22  promulgate any regulation or guideline modifying those elements  of  the\n   23  prescription  form's  contents  specified  in  this  subdivision. To the\n   24  extent otherwise permitted by law, a prescriber may  modify  only  those\n   25  elements  of  the  prescription  form's  contents  not specified in this\n   26  subdivision.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or any\n   27  other law, when a generic drug is not available and the brand name  drug\n   28  originally prescribed is available and the pharmacist agrees to dispense\n   29  the  brand  name product for a price that will not exceed the price that\n   30  would have been charged for the generic substitute had  it  been  avail-\n   31  able,  substitution  of  a generic drug product will not be required. If\n   32  the generic drug product is not available and a medical emergency  situ-\n   33  ation,  which  for  purposes of this section is defined as any condition\n   34  requiring alleviation of severe pain or which threatens to  cause  disa-\n   35  bility or take life if not promptly treated, exists, then the pharmacist\n   36  may  dispense  the  brand  name  product  at  his regular price. In such\n   37  instances the pharmacist must record the date, hour and  nature  of  the\n   38  medical emergency on the back of the prescription and keep a copy of all\n   39  such prescriptions.\n   40    S  3. This act shall not be construed to mean or imply that any refer-\n   41  ence in any statute or regulation to a prescription, signature, or writ-\n   42  ing does not include an electronic prescription,  electronic  signature,\n   43  or entry of information by electronic means, respectively.\n   44    S 4. This act shall take effect immediately.\n",
