  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2437\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the workers' compensation law, in relation to liability for\ncompensation\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo prohibit people from collecting workers' compensation\nbenefits who are injured while in the process of perpetrating of\nfelony a felony or a misdemeanor.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1: Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 10(1) is\namended to include the denial of disability benefits for injuries\nsustained in the perpetration of a felony or misdemeanor, if\nconvicted.\nSection 2: Effective date\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nNone.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nSince the courts have given the Workers' Compensation\nBoard wide latitude in determining whether an employee's conduct\nfalls within the scope of employment, there have been instances where\nemployees who had clearly broken the law when they were injured still\nreceived workers' compensation benefits for that injury. In one\ninstance, the spouse of a roofing employee was awarded benefits for\nher husband's death which occurred as he was in the process of\nsteeling copper down spouts from a work site.\n\nThe disability benefits law (&sect; 205 of the Workers' Compensation Law)\ncurrently provides that no employee shall be entitled to disability\nbenefits for any disability resulting from an injury or sickness\nsustained in the perpetration of a felony or misdemeanor. In Anderson\nv. Cohen, the Court of Appeals determined that there must be a causal\nrelationship between the injury and the felony or misdemeanor.\nWorkers' Compensation benefits should be subject to the same\nstandards as disability benefits with regard to either a felony or\nmisdemeanor of those making claims.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2007-08: Labor\n2010:    Labor\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
