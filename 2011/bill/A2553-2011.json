Resolved (if the Senate concur), That section 12 of article\n    2  3  of the constitution be amended by adding a new undesignated paragraph\n    3  to read as follows:\n    4    UPON THE ENGROSSMENT OF A BILL IN A DIFFERENT FORM BY BOTH  HOUSES,  A\n    5  CONFERENCE COMMITTEE SHALL BE FORMED BY APPOINTMENT OF FOUR MEMBERS FROM\n    6  EACH  HOUSE  BY  THE PRESIDING OFFICERS THEREOF TO SERVE ON A CONFERENCE\n    7  COMMITTEE. THE COMMITTEE SHALL ENDEAVOR TO REACH  A  COMPROMISE  BETWEEN\n    8  THE TWO DRAFT BILLS, AND MAY ONLY DELIBERATE ON THOSE ISSUES THAT DIFFER\n    9  IN THE DRAFTS ENGROSSED BY THE TWO HOUSES.
