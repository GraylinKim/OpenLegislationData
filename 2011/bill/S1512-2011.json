  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1512\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to aggravated criminal conduct\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1: Adds a new Penal Law section 240.75 to create the crime of\naggravated criminal conduct. A person is guilty of aggravated\ncriminal conduct when he or she commits a qualifying misdemeanor, as\nspecified in this section, after having previously committed six or\nmore such qualifying misdemeanors, or felonies, within the previous\nyear. The punishment for aggravated criminal conduct is a Class E\nFelony.\n\nSubdivision (2) of this new section would provide that the provisions\nof Criminal Procedure Law section 200.60, which prohibits allegations\nof previous convictions in indictments for an offense where such\nconvictions are elements of the offense, shall apply to any\nprosecutions for aggravated criminal conduct. Section 200.60 provides\na procedure for allowing defendants to admit their previous\nconviction{s} in the absence of the jury, in which case the\nprosecution may not prove the fact of the previous conviction{s} to\nthe jury. The application of CPL section 200.60 to the offense of\naggravated criminal conduct will help protect defendants from\npotential prejudice by jurors on account of their previous\nconvictions.\n\nThis new Penal Law section would also require that all previous\nconvictions must have been in New York courts and that defendants\nhave had their sentences imposed before commission of the present\nmisdemeanor. Suspended sentences, suspended executions of sentences,\nprobation, parole, and conditional and unconditional discharges are\ndeemed to be sentences, but reversed, vacated, or pardoned\nconvictions will not be deemed previous convictions. Multiple\nsentences for two or more convictions that were imposed at the same\ntime are deemed to constitute only one conviction. Previous\nconvictions already used to convict a defendant of this offense shall\nnot be used to establish guilt for a subsequent prosecution for\naggravated criminal conduct. Finally, in calculating the one-year\nperiod, any period of time during which the defendant was\nincarcerated for any reason between the time of sentence for any of\nthe previous convictions and the time of commission of the present\nmisdemeanor will be excluded.\n\nSection 2 would make this bill effective immediately.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThis bill is intended to assist law enforcement to effectively\nprosecute and sentence repeat misdemeanants, a class of career\ncriminals for which current penalties are ineffective in deterring a\ncontinued life of crime. This small number of criminals is\ndisproportionately responsible for a large number of crimes. The\ncurrent Penal Law does not contain sufficient penalties for\nindividuals who Continue to commit crimes without the fear of any\nserious repercussions.\n\n\nThis new crime of aggravated criminal conduct would allow law\nenforcement to prosecute and sentence repeat misdemeanor offenders\nwho are disproportionately responsible for a large number of\nquality-of-life crimes. For instance, in New York City in 2007, there\nwere 551 offenders with seven or more qualifying criminal convictions\nin the course of the year - a total of 4,542 convictions among them.\nAlthough these individuals only made up 0.8% of all offenders, they\naccounted for 4.3% of total convictions and some have rap sheets over\ntwenty-five pages long.\nThis small group of high-rate serial misdemeanants has a disparate\nimpact on quality of life in the city and often receives little to no\npunishment. By allowing prosecutors to prosecute persistent\nmisdemeanants as felons, this law provides law enforcement with the\nability to target career criminals who continue to commit crimes with\nimpunity.\n\nThis bill was submitted by the City of New York and the Mayor of New\nYork urges that this bill be enacted into law during the 2010\nLegislative session.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediate.\n\n",
