  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1880\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the general business law and the alcoholic beverage control\nlaw,\nin relation to establishing\npenalties for persons who sell alcohol to persons under the age of\ntwenty-one years and increasing fines and length of imprisonment for the\nsale of alcoholic beverages without having the appropriate license\n\nPURPOSE:\nThe purpose of this bill is to deter businesses from selling alcohols\nto persons under 21 years of age. Penalties associated with selling\nalcohol to minors and selling alcohol without a license have been\nincreased to address this problem.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1: Adds a new subdivision (10) to section 441(a} of the\ngeneral business law that expands the grounds for revocation of a\nbarber's license to include selling, giving, or delivering alcohol to\na person under 21 years of age.\n\nSection 2: Amends subdivision 1 of section 130 of the alcoholic\nbeverage control law to increase penalties for those who manufacture\nor sell alcoholic beverages without having the appropriate license,\nor with a revoked or suspended license.\n\nSection 3: Sets the effective date 120 days after it shall become law.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nRecent investigations have found that several barbershops, bodegas and\nother stores are selling illegal and potent alcoholic beverages to\nminors as young as 14. These businesses, which do not have the\nappropriate license to sell alcohol, mix hard alcohol with very\nsugary, colorful drinks and candy in an attempt to market the drink\nto minors. The increased penalties proposed in this bill will deter\nthe unlicensed selling of alcohol to minors.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nThis is a new bill.\n\nCURRENT LAW:\nSection 44l(a) of the general business law does not list selling alcohol\nto those under 21 years of age as grounds for revocation of a barber\nshop license. Section 130 currently makes it a misdemeanor to sell\nalcoholic beverages without the appropriate license and has\nincreasing penalties for 1st, 2nd, and subsequent convictions.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis bill would be effective 120 days after passage.\n\n",
