  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1517\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the labor law and the civil service law, in relation to\nprotection of employees against retaliatory action by employers\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill provides greater protections for \"whistleblower\"\nemployees who disclose information about illegal activities of their\nemployers.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nSection 1: Amends Labor Law section 740 by clarifying the definition\nof \"law, rule or regulation,\" to clearly include state, local and\nfederal laws, rules or regulations and federal judicial and\nadministrative decisions. It clarifies the definition of \"public\nbody\" to include any department of the executive branch and any\ndivision, board or bureau of any public body.\nExpands the term \"retaliatory personnel action\" to include the\ndemotion or discrimination against an employee who \"blew the\nwhistle\". It also defines the term \"insurance fraud\" and \"financial\nfraud\".\n\nThis section also specifies that an employee will be protected against\nretaliatory action for disclosure of employer activity that the\nemployee reasonably evinces abuse of authority, mismanagement or\nwaste of public assets or monies or is a threat to the environment\nand such violation is a substantial and specific danger to the public\nhealth, safety or general welfare or which constitutes insurance\nfraud or financial fraud (in addition to the existing law on health\ncare fraud).\n\nAdds a \"reasonably believes\" requirement relating to the effort of the\nemployee to bring an illegal activity to the attention of the\nemployer in order to be protected and creates certain exceptions when\nsuch employee reasonably believes standard prior to notice to\nemployer is not necessary.\nIt also extends the statute of limitations from one year to two years\nfor bringing a civil action for retaliatory action by an employer.\nFurther, it requires employers to inform their employees of their\nrights under this section.\n\nSection 2: Amends Civil Service Law 75-b (2) by: A) Adding\nprotections, to create parity for whistleblowers protections for\npublic employees as for private employees under Labor Law 740; and B)\nLimiting prior notification to employer requirements.\n\nSection 3: Amends Civil Service Law 75-b (3) to include under the\ndefinition of retaliatory action, the elimination of a job title that\nuniquely singles out such employee.\n\nSection 4: Adds a new Civil Service Law 75-b (5) to require all public\nemployers to inform their employees of their whistle blower rights\nunder this Section of law.\n\n\nEFFECTS OF PRESENT LAW WHICH THIS BILL WOULD ALTER:\nLabor Law &sect; 740\nprohibits private employers from firing or taking any other adverse\nemployment action against an employee who refuses to participate in\nan illegal business activity, or who discloses such illegal activity\nto a public body, if the illegal activity presents a \"substantial and\nspecific danger to the public health or safety.\" This protection does\nnot apply, however, unless the employee has brought the illegal\nbehavior to the attention of a supervisor and has given the employer\nan opportunity to correct the behavior.\n\nCivil Service Law &sect;75-b prohibits public employers from firing or\ntaking any other adverse employment action against a public employee\nwho discloses information:\n(1) regarding a violation of a law, rule or regulation presenting a\nsubstantial and specific danger to the public health and safety; or\n(2) regarding any action by a public employer which the employee\nreasonably believes constitutes a violation of any federal, state or\nlocal law, rule or regulation. Prior to disclosing the information,\nthe employee must make a good faith effort to inform his or her\nemployer and to give the employer a reasonable time to take\nappropriate action, unless there is an imminent and serious danger to\nthe public health or safety.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIn 1984, private and public employees in New York State who report\nillegal or improper activities by their employers are given certain\nprotections under New York's whistleblower protection law.\nUnfortunately, there are several certain weaknesses in the current\nwhistleblower law. These weaknesses greatly limit the protections\nprovided to employees. Further, it deters honest employees from\nrevealing illegal activities of their employers, out of the\nlegitimate fear that they will be dismissed for reporting such\nviolations.\n\nFirst, Labor Law &sect; 740 only protects employees who disclose illegal\nactivities that present a \"substantial and specific danger to the\npublic health or safety.\" Thus, if an employee becomes aware that his\nor her employer is knowingly defrauding its customers, or stealing\nfrom government authorities, the whistleblower law will provide no\nprotection to the employee.\n\nSecond, a private employee who reasonably believes that his or her\nemployer has engaged in actions which the employee reasonably\nbelieves constitute a violation of law can be terminated for\nrevealing that information to government authorities, if it turns out\nthat no violation can be proved in court. The civil Service Law was\namended in 1986 to protect public employees who reasonably believe\nthat a violation has occurred, but private employees still do not\nhave that protection.\n\nNew York's whistleblower statutes are also not especially effective\nbecause they generally do not apply unless the employee has brought\nthe illegal\nbehavior to the attention of a supervisor and has given the employer\nan opportunity to correct the illegal behavior. Unfortunately, many\nemployees do not know of this requirement, and are never told by\n\n\ntheir employers that they can be fired if they do not first tell\nthe employer of the illegal activity. The employer notification\nrequirement set forth in Civil Service Law &sect; 740, means that private\nemployees can be fired for reporting violations, unreported to the\nemployer, even where such present an imminent and serious threat.\n\nAlthough Labor Law &sect; 740 prohibits adverse employment actions against\nprivate employees who refuse to participate in illegal business\nactivities, Civil Service Law &sect; 75-b does not contain a similar\nprovision.\nThis means that public employees can be fired for refusing to violate\nthe law. Finally, the remedies available to employees under Labor\nLaw, &sect; 740 are clearly inadequate.\n\nThis bill addresses these numerous defects in the current Whistle\nblower statues. It implements certain recommendations made by New\nYork State Law Revision Commission following a five year study of the\nlaw, and enacts, for all employees, protections similar to those\nextended to healthcare workers during the 2002 legislative session.\n\nNew York State should encourage, not discourage, employees who wish to\nreport violations of law by their employers. Although the\n\"whistleblower Law\" enacted in 1984 was a good first step, experience\nover the past 20 years has shown that the law is simply inadequate.\nBy making the necessary reforms to strengthen the law, this bill will\nact as a deterrent to employers who might otherwise engage in illegal\nactivity, will protect the public from such wrongdoing, and will\nensure that the honest and law-abiding employees who have the\ncourage to reveal illegal activities are protected against\nretaliation by their employers.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\nSimilar to Attorney General departmental bills 2007 (A.3487); 2004\nlegislative session (A.8794), and a similar bill was submitted during\nthe 2001-002 legislative session. This bill is similar to S.5737/A.7144A\n(Klein/Benedetto)which passed the Assembly and Senate, but\nwas vetoed by Governor Paterson on several technical grounds. This\nbill incorporates all of the comments contained in Veto Message 72\nand if passed by both the Assembly and Senate, should be signed into\nlaw.In 2010 the bill was referred to Labor and committed to Codes\nas bill S.7060.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nThis bill will have a positive impact by reducing fraud\nand misuse of public funds by government agencies and contractors.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect 180 days after it shall have become\na law.\n\n",
