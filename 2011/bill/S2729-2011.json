  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2729\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the environmental conservation law, in relation to cadmium-added\nnovelty consumer products\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill would prohibit the sale of jewelry, toys or\nornaments to which cadmium has been added intentionally during\nformulation or manufacturing.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\n* define \"cadmium-added consumer novelty product\" to mean a product\nintended for personal use or adornment that contains cadmium in an\namount equal to or in excess of .0075 percent by weight.\n\n* prohibit the sale, offer for sale or free distribution of\ncadmium-added novelty consumer products after June 1, 2013; and,\n\n* require a manufacturer that produces or sells cadmium-added novelty\nproducts to notify retailers of such ban and inform them how to\nproperly dispose of the remaining inventory.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nThis legislation adds a new title 2 to Article 27 of the\nEnvironmental Conservation Law.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nCadmium is a metal that is inexpensive, malleable and\nhighly resistant to corrosion, making it desirable for use in\nplastics as a stabilizer and in electroplating; however cadmium\ninterferes with how the body uses calcium and has been associated\nwith harmful health impacts including cancer and kidney disease.\n\nAn Associated Press story found high levels of cadmium in low priced\nchildren's jewelry on sale in the United States. This legislation\nwould help protect the health and safety of children and consumers by\nprohibiting the inclusion of cadmium in jewelry, toys and ornaments.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010: A.9755B Reported from Codes\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
