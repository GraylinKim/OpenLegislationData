  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1770\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public authorities\nlaw, in relation to requiring the metropolitan transportation authority\nto hold a public hearing prior to the awarding of a sole source contract\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nThis amendment requires the New York city transit authority to hold a\npublic hearing prior to awarding a sole source contract without\ncompetitive bidding thereon.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThis bill would amend Section 1265-b of the public authorities law.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nNew York State law regarding competitive bidding procedures by the\nMetropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) for Metro-Card Automated\nVending Machines (AVMS).\n\nThe MTA never entertained competitive bids for the 500 AVMS ordered\nfrom Cubic in 1993 or in 1996 when the order was doubled to 1,000 AVMS.\nThese are two possible violations of the New York State public\nAuthorities Law governing competitive bidding procedures. The MTA\nthen approved a $5 million contract with Cubic's partner, Electronic\nData systems (EDS) , to oversee Cubic's performance.\n\nIt is fiscally prudent for the MTA to participate in competitive\nbidding procedures, especially where sole source contracts are\nawarded. Lack of such participation raises serious questions among\nthe tax-payers of New York. A public hearing would grant the public\nan opportunity to be better informed of such contracts and give them\nan opportunity to express their opinions on the matter.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.5056 (2009-10) Referred to Transportation; Finance\nA.4712 (2007-08) Referred to Corporations, Authorities and Commissions\nA.9665 (2005-06) Referred to Corporations, Authorities and Commissions\nA.5854 (2003-04) Referred to Corporations, Authorities and Commissions\nA.5303 (2001-02) Referred to Corporations, Authorities and Commissions\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the thirtieth day after it shall have\nbecome a law.\n\n",
