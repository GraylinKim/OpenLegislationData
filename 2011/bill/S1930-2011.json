  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1930\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the vehicle and traffic law, in relation to\nrequiring persons convicted of driving while\nintoxicated who are injured as a result of such\noffense and who are medically transported to a hospital\nto pay for such transport and\nother pre-hospital medical bills before their license\nto drive can be reissued to them\n\nPURPOSE:\nThe intent of this bill is to ensure that EMS providers are financially\ncompensated for transport services that they perform for individuals\nwho are injured as a result of committing a DWI offense.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1. Paragraph (c) of subdivision 2 of section 1193 of the\nvehicle and traffic law is amended by adding a new subparagraph 4\nwhich states that no person who has been convicted of committing a\nDWI offense which has resulted in the transport of such person by\nambulance or helicopter can have their license restored or renewed\nuntil they have submitted proof of payment for such transport and any\nother pre-hospital medical expenses.\n\nSection 2. Paragraph (c) of subdivision 2 of section 1193 of the\nvehicle and traffic law, as amended by section 8 of chapter 732 of\nthe laws of 2006, is amended by stating the same.\n\nSection 3. Sets the effective date.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nExisting law makes no such provisions.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIn 1996 there were 7,048 DWI related accidents in New York State which\nresulted in 10,050 injuries and 320 deaths. Continuous efforts by the\nNew York State Legislature to create stricter DWI laws have worked to\nsignificantly lower the incidence of DWI offenses in our state.\nHowever, drunk drivers continue to wreak havoc on our communities.\nThe numbers of accidents, injuries, and fatalities that are the\nresult of alcohol induced recklessness are still too great.\n\nEveryday emergency medical service providers place their lives on the\nline in an effort to protect the health and safety of their\ncommunities.\nOften, those who injure themselves while driving intoxicated require\ntransport by ambulance or helicopter, and recurrently these offenders\ndo not pay EMS for the cost of transport. These brave and hard\nworking individuals deserve to be compensated for their services,\n\nespecially in cases where individuals have recklessly injured\nthemselves and others by committing a DWI offense.\n\nEmergency transport services provide lifesaving assistance,\ntransporting critically ill or injured adults and children regardless\nof their ability to pay for such services.\nMany insurance companies do not pay for emergency medical transport\nservices, and of those that do, the full cost of transport is\ngenerally not covered. Additionally, many New Yorkers have no medical\ninsurance. As a result, loss of revenue for emergency transport\nproviders is substantial.\nReceipt of payment is essential in maintaining EMS services. Lack of\npayment jeopardizes the existence of these much needed services. We\nmust not allow drunk drivers to further threaten our safety by\nrefusing to pay for EMS services.\n\nThis legislation takes a hard stance with DWI offenders, and sends the\nmessage that New York State does not tolerate drunk drivers. It\ncontinues this legislature's tradition of using tough methods to\ncombat this life threatening problem. It is one more step in the\nfight to end the senseless injury and death that is too often the\nresult of driving under the influence of alcohol.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2005-2006: S.2274 - Transportation\n2003-2004: S.42-A Rules (Alcoholism and Drug Abuse)\n2007-2008: Passed Senate\n2009-2010: Referred to Transportation\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the first day of September 1, 2012.\n\n",
