DUANE  -- read twice and ordered printed, and when\n         printed to be committed to the Committee on Labor\n\n       AN ACT to amend the workers' compensation law, in relation  to  enacting\n         the \"protection in the workplace act\"\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Short title.  This act shall be known and may be  cited  as\n    2  the \"protection in the workplace act\".\n    3    S  2.  Legislative  intent. It is the finding of this legislature that\n    4  violence in the workplace has become  an  increasingly  serious  occupa-\n    5  tional hazard, which all too many employees and employers must confront.\n    6  While  it  is  the intent of the workers' compensation system to provide\n    7  medical aid and monetary compensation to injured workers or their survi-\n    8  vors in return for the surrender of their right to petition the  courts,\n    9  it  is  the  finding of this body that rape, sexual assault or other sex\n   10  crimes should not be classified as a  condition  of  employment  at  the\n   11  expense  of  the  workers'  compensation system's ameliorative goals and\n   12  that such system is not and should not be used as  a  shield  to  permit\n   13  employers  whose  negligent  acts  or  omissions cause injury or harm to\n   14  fellow employees without such injured employees having every opportunity\n   15  for full and adequate redress.   For purposes  of  determining  benefits\n   16  pursuant  to  the  workers' compensation law, sexual assault is not, and\n   17  shall not be considered a condition of employment.\n   18    It is therefore the intent of this legislation to ensure that  workers\n   19  suffering  sexual assault in the workplace due to the derelict or negli-\n   20  gent practices of their employer, receive appropriate medical  care  and\n   21  benefits  but also have every opportunity to recover all damages commen-\n   22  surate with their injury.\n   23    S 3. The workers' compensation law is amended by adding a new  section\n   24  10-a to read as follows:\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD00660-01-1\n\n       S. 1227                             2\n\n    1    S 10-A.

For purposes of this section the terms  \"indemnity\"  and  \"contrib-\n   41  ution\"  shall not include a claim or cause of action for contribution or\n   42  indemnification based upon a provision in  a  written  contract  entered\n   43  into  prior  to  the  accident  or  occurrence by which the employer had\n   44  expressly agreed to contribution to or indemnification of  the  claimant\n   45  or person asserting the cause of action for the type of loss suffered.\n   46    3.

  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1227\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the workers' compensation law, in relation to enacting the\n\"protection in the workplace act\"\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nTo clarify that the workers' compensation law was never intended to\nbar employees suffering a personal injury as a result of a sexual\nassault in the workplace from pursuing legal action seeking damages from\ntheir employer.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\n&sect;1 of the bill provides that this act shall be known as the\nProtection in the Workplace Act.\n\n&sect;2 of the bill specifies a legislative intent that workers'\ncompensation was not intended to bar civil actions by\nemployees suffering\npersonal injury as a result of a sexual assault by\nnegligent acts or omissions of their employer.\n\n&sect;3 of the bill provides that an employee suffering personal injury\nas a consequence of a sexual offense due to the negligent acts or\nomissions of an employer shall be entitled to all rights and benefits\nof the Workers' Compensation law, and in\naddition may pursue any remedy\navailable for damages.\n\n&sect;4 of the bill provides that workers' compensation should be the\nexclusive remedy except that workers' suffering a personal injury as a\nresult of a sexual offense should not be\nbarred from civil action.  However, their workers' compensation\ncarrier\nwould be entitled to a lien on the proceeds of any award in the amount\nof benefits paid.\n\n&sect;5 of the bill clarifies that workers' compensation should be the\nexclusive remedy except when the employee suffers personal injury as a\nresult of a sexual offense.\n\nEFFECTS OF PRESENT LAW WHICH THIS BILL WOULD ALTER:\nThis is an issue of first impression in New York, but it is clear\nthat the workers' compensation statute should not be interpreted to\nbar otherwise meritorious civil claims by employees injured at work by\na sexual offense.  Thus the intent of this\nbill is to clarify what is clearly the correct interpretation of the\nstatute that certain workplace accidents should not be barred from\ncivil remedy by considering workers' compensation as the exclusive\nremedy.\n\nAs a result of this legislation, no longer would employers\nbe able to claim that sexual\nassaults of their employees due to their negligent acts or omissions\n(such as lack of security for the safety of its employees)\nis a condition of employment.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nWorkplace violence is an increasingly prevalent occupational hazard,\nand it is a particularly acute problem for women in the workforce.\nWhile workers' compensation should be available to those injured by a\nsexual\noffense committed in the workplace, it should not be the exclusive\nremedy, since there are sometimes egregious instances of employer\nmalfeasance and negligence in the workplace\nwhich\ntragically lead to the workplace sexual assault or injury.\n\nA recent report\nby the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health reveals\nthat violence in the workplace is a significant factor in\noccupational death in New York City and the state.\nIt should be clear that the workers'\ncompensation law was never intended to be a shield in such\nsituations, and it\nis indeed unfortunate that an already victimized employee should be\nforced to endure an employer's claim that a violent and repeated\nsexual\nassault was a natural condition of her employment.\n\nThe purpose of this legislative initiative is to clarify the\nstatute, consistent with public policy while placing a clear\nprohibition on\ndouble recovery.  According to this bill, if the plaintiff\nsuccessfully sues, there would be an offset of that award for workers'\ncompensation benefits received.\n\nThe legislative intent of this amendment is based on several\nelementary principles.  The primary goal behind this legislation is to\nconfirm that the entire system of workers' compensation in our state\nhas evolved to protect employees from those accidents\nnaturally associated\nwith the businesses' operation.  Under New York law,\nsexual assault should\nnot be an act within the scope of employment, nor can it ever be\nconstrued as in furtherance of an employer's business.\n\nAccordingly,\nsexual assault should not be a per se work related injury.  As\nstated by\nProfessor Larson, the noted workers' compensation scholar, \"there is\nno clearer example of non-industrial motive than rape.\" (1 Larson,\nWorkmen's Compensation at 11.11 b).  No employer therefore, should\n\nbe\nin a position of advising a woman that she should expect to be\nsexually assaulted or abused at her place of employment, that in\nthose\nrare instances where she suffers this abuse, she should not be barred\nfrom pursuing civil remedy for her damages.\nIt should also be noted that New York case law supports this remedy,\nsince it does not apply a \"positional risk\" or \"but for\" standard\nwhen determining the compensability of an injury.  New York courts\nrequire that the injury be a direct and natural risk of the job, and\nspecifically, that the injury be suffered l) while the worker is\ndoing the duty\nshe or he is employed to perform, and 2) that it be a natural\nincident of the work.\n\nThe injury must be one of the risks connected\nwith the employment, flowing as a natural consequence and directly\nconnected with the risk. (See Matter of Hertz v.\nRapered, 218\nN.Y. 148, 151-52 (1916); Caliv v. Consolidated Railroad\nCompany,\n229 N.Y. 489, 494\n(1920); Matter of Scholzhauer v. C.& L. Lunch Co., 233\nN.Y.2\n(1922); Pryor v. Presbyterian Home for Aged, 9\nN.Y.2d 869, 870\n(1961)).\n\nNew York State's case law provides that injury arises out of\nemployment when it has its origin in an employee's work related\nfunctions,\nand is sufficiently related to the employment function as to be\nconsidered a part of the employee's service to the employer in\nconnection\nwith the contract of employment.  As sexual assault or abuse are not\ninherent risks in employment, it is well-founded to conclude that\nworkers' compensation was never intended to be a bar to civil causes\nof action.\n\nThe legislative incentive of our workers' compensation system to\nencourage a safe work place is lost if a negligent employer is allowed\nto use this beneficent system as a shield from liability. Indeed for\nan employer to claim that sexual assault is an expected or intended\nconsequence of employment results in the victim again being demeaned\nand insulted through a rigid and uncaring system of multiple hearings\nand insufficient medical treatment.  It has been posted that since\nthe workers' compensation system was never intended to compensate\nvictims of sexual assault it cannot compensate a woman for a\npsychological or emotional injury suffered from such a crime.\n\nThe existence of\na noncompensable injury should be enough to abrogate the exclusive\n\nremedy provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act.  Of course, this\nis\nwhy intentional torts are not a class of injuries protected under the\nworkers' compensation scheme.\nWhere the damages alleged are purely emotional in nature, the\nlegislature never intended the exclusivity provisions to bar a\ncommon law\nclaim.  Injuries due to sexual assault are founded in humiliation,\nemotional distress, pain and suffering and leave permanent yet\ninvisible\nscars with a woman for the rest of her life.  That a workers'\ncompensation award would merely cover the injured employee's\npsychiatric\nbills is a sufficient basis for granting a woman the right to file a\ntort claim against all responsible parties for causing irreparable\ninjury and damage to the plaintiff's self-esteem, privacy and\nreputation.\n\nThe employer who creates an unsafe workplace due to negligent acts\nor omissions should not be permitted\nto socialize this cost among the many safe and responsible employers\nin our state; thus, it is other employers and ultimately their\ncustomers as the public at large who ultimately pay for such\nirresponsibility.  As a deterrent and as public policy the negligent\nemployer\nshould\nnot be permitted to use workers' compensation as a wall protecting\ntheir culpability where rape is the tragic consequence.\n\nIt is also clear that the workers' compensation statute should be\napplied in a manner consistent with our public policy to discourage\nand\nprevent violence in the workplace -- this legislation provides a\ndeterrent and an obligation while ensuring that no double enrichment\ntakes place. The sponsors of this legislation believe in the right of\nwomen and indeed all workers to engage in their livelihood free from\nthe threat of sexual assault in the workplace.  When\nthat\naspiration is diminished, the legislature must respond and clearly\nenunciate that it is our sense and understanding that any\ninterpretation that would establish workers' compensation as the\nexclusive\nremedy\nin such circumstances is incorrect as a matter of law.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n1999-00: S.3955-B      Died in Senate Labor Committee\n2001-02: S.1986        Died in Senate Labor Committee\n2003-04: S.1829        Died in Senate Labor Committee\n2005-06: S.307         Died in Senate Labor Committee\n2007:    S.1572        Died in Senate Labor Committee\n2008:    S.1572        Died in Senate Labor Committee\n\n2009:    S.1795/A.7767 Died in Senate Labor/Died in Assembly Labor\n2010:    S.1795/A/7767 Died in Senate Third Reading/Died in\nAssembly Labor\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
