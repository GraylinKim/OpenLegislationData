  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1325\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the election law, in relation to counting of affidavit ballots\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nTo provide for the casting and counting of ballots of voters, otherwise\neligible, when the voter appears at the wrong Election District but\nwithin the proper county\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nAmends Section 9-209 sub 2(a) by adding a new subparagraph 3 to require\nThe Board of Elections to cast and count such ballots.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\n\nIn Panio & c. V. Sunderland et al., _NY3d,_, the Court of Appeals held\nthat, under existing law, such ballots should not be counted\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nInspectors are required to offer an affidavit ballot when the voter\nappears at the proper Election District but the name cannot be found in\nthe poll record. If the inspectors offer an affidavit ballot to a voter\nwho appears at the wrong Election District, this is an error of the\nBoard of Elections employee. The voter reasonably assumes that his or\nher vote has been correctly cast. The voter should not be\ndisenfranchised by an error made by the Board employee.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n2009/10:  S.1701/A.6971A - Advanced to Third Reading\n2007/08:  S.1494 - Referred to Elections\n2007/08:  A.8336 - Referred to Elections\n2005/06:  A.6600 - Referred to Elections\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nImmediately.\n\n",
