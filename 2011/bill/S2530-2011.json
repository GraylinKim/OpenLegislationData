  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2530\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the general obligations law, in relation to certain provisions\nof contracts and debt or equity securities of debt evading foreign\nstates and state-owned corporations of debt evading foreign states to be\nvoid as against public policy\n\nPURPOSE OF BILL:\nThis bill will amend the general\nobligations law by\nprohibiting certain foreign states, their agencies or\ninstrumentalities, and their state-owned corporations, against whom\nfinal judgments of at least $100 million have remained unpaid for two\nyears (collectively \"debt evading foreign states\"), from amending\ntheir debt or equity securities, or contracts governing them\n(collectively \"obligations\") by revoking, amending, changing or\neliminating (collectively \"amendment\") provisions in such obligations\nwhich in any way relate to a holder's enforcement rights under such\nobligations, as void as against public policy and unenforceable\nagainst any holder that has not affirmatively agreed to such\namendment, when the passage of the amendment is by reason of the\nvotes of holders of such obligations who will no longer be holders\nupon passes of the amendment. As a result of this bill, holders of\nsuch obligations, most of which were issued in New York, governed by\nNew York law, and which contain waivers of immunity and consents to\nsuit in New York, will not be stripped of their ability to enforce\ntheir rights under such obligations, including enforcing judgments\nrendered against debt evading foreign states, based upon the vote\nof holders of such obligations who by reason the passage of such\namendment will no longer remain holders. This bill will prevent debt\nevading foreign states from using exit consents to escape their\nobligations, including judgments, with respect to non-participants in\ndebt exchanges. For the avoidance of doubt, this bill also provides\nthat all of the commitments and duties of debt avoiding foreign\nstates and enforcement rights of holders of the debt and equity\nsecurities of debt evading foreign states shall survive the entry of\nfinal judgment against any such debt evading foreign state and shall\nnot be merged into any such final judgment.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 defines the circumstances under which\na foreign state and its agencies, instrumentalities and state-owned\ncorporations become debt evading foreign states. It then provides\nthat any attempt by such debt evading foreign states to impair the\nenforcement rights of holders of its obligations shall be void and\nunenforceable as against any holder who did not affirmatively vote in\nfavor of the amendment revoking such enforcement right, when the\namendment passes by reason of the votes of holders of obligations who\nwill no longer be holders after passage of the\namendment. Section 1 also ensures that the duties and commitments of\n\ndebt evading\nforeign states and the enforcement rights of holders of its debt or\nequity securities shall survive the entry of final judgment against\nany such debt evading foreign state and shall\nnot be merged in any such final judgment. Section 2 provides that the\nact will take effect immediately.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nNew York taxpayers have invested billions of dollars\nin debt issued by foreign sovereigns. To facilitate the issuance of\ntheir debt to New York citizens and other individuals through New\nYork's capital markets, many foreign sovereigns designate New York as\nthe place of payment and the venue where the foreign sovereign waives\nsovereign immunity and consents to jurisdiction to be sued in the\ncase of a default. As a result, actions to enforce defaulted debt are\nfrequently brought in state and federal courts located in New York.\nAlthough many foreign sovereigns pay their debts responsibly, some\nforeign sovereigns that are capable of making payments to their\ncreditors instead choose to repudiate their debts and to refuse to\npay judgments rendered against them. Because of the difficulties\nassociated with enforcing judgments against foreign sovereigns, New\nYork taxpayers suffer significant losses, and have little legal\nrecourse, when foreign sovereigns choose not to pay their debts. The\nlosses incurred by taxpayers significantly affect New York tax\nrevenue, not only because New York cannot tax interest and other\ngains that are not paid, but also because investors' losses can be\noffset against other taxable gains.\n\nThe most egregious example of a foreign sovereign that is capable of\npaying its debt, but that chooses not to, is the Republic of\nArgentina. In 2001, Argentina defaulted on $81.2 billion of debt,\nwhich is the largest sovereign debt default in history. Argentina\nrefused to negotiate with its bondholders until 2005, and then\noffered the bondholders an exchange worth about 25-cents on the\ndollar on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.\n\nApproximately 76 percent of\nbondholders accepted the exchange offer, and Argentina repudiated the\nremaining portion of its debt. Argentina has repudiated these debts\nwhile claiming, in a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, to have a debt-to-gross domestic product ratio of 49.1 % -\nless than the ratios of Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany,\nand a variety of other European countries - and a budget surplus in\neach year from 2004 to 2008.\n\nDozens of lawsuits have been filed in the United States District Court\nfor the Southern District of New York as a result of the Argentine\ndebt default. The two largest creditors alone have claims and\njudgments of over $3 billion. Judge Thomas P. Griesa, the most senior\njudge in the Southern District, has repeatedly observed that\nArgentina has never offered to pay the judgments rendered against it\nand instead focused all of its efforts on protecting its assets from\n\ncreditors. In May 2009, Judge Griesa held that Argentina was in civil\ncontempt of court for failing to comply with court orders and drew an\nadverse inference that Argentina had removed assets from New York in\nviolation of court orders.\n\nThe economic impact of this debt repudiation has been substantial. The\ndirect net costs to New York holders of defaulted Argentine debt\ncurrently total $902 million, including $452 million in capital\nlosses, $382 million in foregone interest payments, and $180 million\nin foregone investment returns, less nearly $112 million in tax\nbenefits created by the losses or foregone income. From December 2001\nto December 2008, the indirect\ncosts of the Argentine debt default, through lost tax revenue, total\napproximately $329 million.\n\nThis bill will prevent debt evading foreign states such as Argentina,\nwhich is presently preparing an offer to exchange certain of its\ndefaulted debt for new debt of lesser value, from including in the\ndebt exchange provisions a requirement that those holders exchanging\ntheir debt vote to extinguish the enforcement rights of holders who\ndo not participate in the exchange but seek to enforce their rights,\nincluding judgment enforcement rights, in the courts.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nNew bill.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\nAt present, at\nleast one debt evading foreign state, the Republic of Argentina, is\ncontemplating a securities offering that is likely to include sales\nor offers for the sale of securities in New York. Argentina has filed\na registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission\nrelating to the offer and sale of securities having an aggregate\nprincipal amount of up to$15 billion. If Argentina is prevented from\nextinguishing the right of holders who do not participate in the\nexchange to enforce their rights and judgments against Argentina, New\nYork may collect substantial capital gains and avoid the deduction\nfrom taxes of capital losses with respect to any judgments that are\nsatisfied by Argentina either by agreement or by execution against\nits property.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
