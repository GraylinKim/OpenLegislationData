CAHILL, GOTTFRIED, GUNTHER, JACOBS, ROSENTHAL,\n         COLTON, PAULIN,  CLARK,  BROOK-KRASNY,  MAISEL,  JAFFEE,  ENGLEBRIGHT,\n         WEINSTEIN,  CYMBROWITZ,  WEPRIN, BURLING, MONTESANO -- Multi-Sponsored\n         by -- M. of  A.  BOYLAND,  CROUCH,  GALEF,  GLICK,  LATIMER,  McENENY,\n         PEOPLES-STOKES,  PHEFFER, RAIA, SCHIMEL, SWEENEY, TITONE, TITUS, WEIS-\n         ENBERG -- read once and referred to the Committee on Health\n\n       AN ACT to amend the public health law and part C of chapter  58  of  the\n         laws  of  2005, amending the public health law and other laws relating\n         to implementing the state fiscal plan for the 2005-2006  fiscal  year,\n         in relation to prescription privacy\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Legislative findings and intent.  Prescribing  health  care\n    2  professionals  should  have  a  reasonable  expectation  that  when they\n    3  prescribe a medication for a patient, that decision  will  not  be  made\n    4  available  to  an outside third party. However, disclosure of individual\n    5  identifying information about patients and prescribers  enables  pharma-\n    6  ceutical  companies  to track the prescribing practices of physicians to\n    7  target them for marketing, including gifts and payments.  This marketing\n    8  can distort prescribing practices to  increase  health  care  costs  and\n    9  undermine  patient  safety.  The National Institutes of Health has found\n   10  that nearly one-third of the increase in prescription drug  prices  over\n   11  the   last  decade  was  attributable  to  marketing-induced  shifts  in\n   12  prescribing practices. Published evidence  shows  that  prescribers  are\n   13  often  encouraged by sales representatives to prescribe medications in a\n   14  manner that has not been approved by the Federal Food and Drug  Adminis-\n   15  tration.\n   16    Neither  the  state  nor  any other entity has the resources to effec-\n   17  tively counter targeted marketing  campaigns  that  exceed  hundreds  of\n   18  millions of dollars.\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD01177-01-1\n\n       A. 364                              2\n\n    1    The  legislature  finds  that this legislation is necessary to protect\n    2  health care professionals and their patients from the abuses of targeted\n    3  marketing that are made possible by the disclosure of individual identi-\n    4  fying information.\n    5    S 2. Section 270 of the public health law is amended by adding two new\n    6  subdivisions 15 and 16 to read as follows:\n    7    15. \"INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION\" MEANS INFORMATION IDENTIFYING\n    8  OR TENDING TO IDENTIFY A PRESCRIBER OR PATIENT, WHERE THE INFORMATION IS\n    9  DERIVED FROM OR RELATES TO A PRESCRIPTION FOR ANY DRUG OR DEVICE.\n   10    16.  \"MARKETING\" MEANS, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ADVERTISING, DETAILING,\n   11  MARKETING, PROMOTION, OR ANY ACTIVITY THAT COULD BE  USED  TO  INFLUENCE\n   12  SALES  OR  MARKET  SHARE  OF A DRUG OR DEVICE, INFLUENCE OR EVALUATE THE\n   13  PRESCRIBING PRACTICES OF A PRESCRIBER, OR EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS  OF\n   14  MARKETING PRACTICES OR PERSONNEL.\n   15    S 3. The public health law is amended by adding a new section 276-c to\n   16  read as follows:\n   17    S 276-C. PRESCRIPTION PRIVACY. 1. NO PRESCRIBER, PHARMACIST, PHARMACY,\n   18  PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGER, HEALTH PLAN, INSURER, THIRD PARTY PAYER, DATA\n   19  TRANSFER  INTERMEDIARY,  DRUG MANUFACTURER OR WHOLESALER OR THEIR AGENTS\n   20  SHALL DISCLOSE, SELL, TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR USE ANY INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFY-\n   21  ING INFORMATION TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY FOR THE PURPOSE OF MARKETING ANY\n   22  DRUG OR DEVICE.\n   23    2.
