  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1238\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public authorities law, in relation to the board of\nthe metropolitan transportation authority; and\nin relation to the establishment of\nthe metropolitan transit authority riders' council for people with\ndisabilities\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nTo establish an advisory council which has a non-voting member seat on\nthe Metropolitan Transportation Authority which is comprised by\nregular transit users, who are also people with disabilities, in\norder to ensure better oversight of how the Authority accommodates\nriders with disabilities.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThe bill establishes the Metropolitan Transportation Authority Riders'\nCouncil for People with Disabilities to study and investigate all\naspects of the day-to-day operations of the Metropolitan\nTransportation Authority and its subsidiaries, monitor its\nperformance, and make recommendations to improve its operation.\n\nThe bill requires that the Council shall consist of fifteen members\nwho are regular transit users and who are people with disabilities.\nOne member shall be appointed by the governor on the recommendation\nof the mayor of the city of New York; one on the recommendation of the\npresident of the city council; one on the recommendation of the New\nYork state comptroller; one on the recommendation of each of the\nborough presidents of the city of New York; one on the recommendation\nof each of the county executives of Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland,\nPutnam, Dutchess, and Orange. Each of the members shall serve for\ntwo-year terms. The Council shall select a Chair from its membership.\nVacancies shall be filled in the same manner as the original\nappointments for the balance of the original member's term.\n\nThe bill requires that the members of the Council will receive no\ncompensation but will be reimbursed for necessary expenses.\n\nThe bill requires that the Council shall provide support services to\nits members so that they may perform their duties, including but not\nlimited to transportation, telecommunication, and\naccessible technology support. The Chair may hire staff and\nconsultants for any funds made available to the Council.\n\nThe bill allows that the Council may request and shall receive\nassistance and data from any political subdivision of the state to\nenable it to properly carry out its duties.\n\nThe bill creates an additional non-voting member of the Metropolitan\nTransportation Authority who shall serve an eighteen-month term and\nis recommended to the governor by the Metropolitan Transportation\nAuthority Riders' Council for People with Disabilities.\n\nThe bill provides a definition for \"disability\" and \"disabled.\"\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIn New York City, only 53 out of 468 MTA passenger stations are\nADA-compliant for people in wheelchairs. Elevator and escalator\nmaintenance problems are rampant and little is done to alert riders\nwho depend on these facilities about breakdowns and alternative\nroutes. The hard of hearing are unable to make sense of train\nannouncements even though technology exists that could improve this.\nPlatform gaps, a noted problem on the Long Island Railroad, are of a\nparticular threat to the safety of the visually impaired. The recent\nclosure of station agent booths and the elimination of many station\nagent personnel disproportionately impact those with disabilities.\nNew York City and its commuter rails are far behind other major\ncities in accommodating the needs of riders with disabilities.\n\nOne of the most important ways we can begin to address this crisis is\nto correct the lack of representation of people on the board of the\nMTA itself. In 2006, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer\npublished The State of Repairs: An Examination of Elevator and\nEscalator Maintenance and Repairs in New York City 's Subway System.\nIn this report, he concluded that while the MTA does have the New\nYork City Transit Riders Council \"they are not charged with the\nspecific responsibly of representing the needs of disabled riders.\nAnd while the MTA has an ADA compliance coordination committee, it\nis informal and not comprised of appointed members. A\nlegislatively-mandated body representing disabled riders is needed to\nensure the issues of the disability community are identified and\naddressed.\"\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009:  S.1386 (Duane), Died in Finance; A.3954 (Kellner), Passed\nAssembly\n2010:  S.1386B (Duane), Died in Finance; A.3954B (Kellner), Passed\nAssembly\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nUnknown.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately, with provisions.\n\n",
