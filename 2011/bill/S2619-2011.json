  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2619\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the banking law, in relation to attorney trust accounts\n\nPURPOSE/SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThis bill would add new section 9-v to\nthe Banking Law to provide that no bank or trust company regulated by\nthe State of New York shall charge a service fee or require a minimum\nbalance on an attorney trust account, provided that such account is\nrequired by law and that no more than fifteen debit or credit\ntransactions per month are made in connection with such account and\nfurther provided that such account is non-interest bearing. This bill\nwould also define 'attorney trust account' as a special bank or\nchecking account required by a rule of court for deposit of funds\nbelonging to legal clients or other persons in the practice of law.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nAn attorney in possession of any asset\nor sum of money\nbelonging to a client is a fiduciary and must not commingle client\nfunds with his or her own funds or personal or business accounts.\nFurthermore, an attorney must maintain in a bank or trust company\nwithin the State of New York in his or her own name, or in the name\nof the firm of attorneys of which he or she is a member, a special\naccount independent from his or her personal accounts. In many areas\nof the state, banks require minimum deposits or service fees for the\nmaintenance of these accounts. Such requirements can be financially\nburdensome to the small practicing attorney who handles only a few\ncases which would require the collection and deposit of clients'\nfunds. This bill would ameliorate this situation by providing that no\nbank or trust company regulated by New York State shall charge a\nservice fee or require a minimum balance on an attorney trust account\nprovided that such account is required by law and that no more than\nfifteen debit or credit transactions per month are made in connection\nwith such account.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the thirtieth day after\nit shall have become a law.\n\n",
