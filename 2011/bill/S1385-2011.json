  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1385\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public service law, in relation to requiring utility\ncompanies to include a notice of public hearings concerning rate\nincreases\n\nPURPOSE OF BILL:\nThis legislation requires utility companies to post notification of\ndate and place of proposed hearings concerning rate hikes on the\nmonthly bills.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nUtility rate hikes over the years have been the subject of tremendous\ncontroversy. Many consumers feel that the present system of\nnotification is inadequate and that the most common method of\nnotification occurs after the fact via the media or the actual\nincrease in the monthly payment. This legislation is intended to\naddress the issue of inadequate notification by requiring utility\ncompanies to post the date and place of the hearings on the\ncustomer's bill for service. This is a more appropriate method of\nnotifying consumers so that they may plan to attend the hearing or\nsubmit comments.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nSponsored by M/A Lafayette 1993-1994 - S.5463\n1995-1996 - S.896A\n1997-1998 - A.8810\n1999-2000 - S.719A, A.894A\n2001-02 (A.1292/S.1046)\n2003-04 (A.65/S.4541)\n2005-06 (A.172/S.1248)\n2007-08 (A.60)\n2009-10 (S.3573A)\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall have\nbecome a law.\n\n",
