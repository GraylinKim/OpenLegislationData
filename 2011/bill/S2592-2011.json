  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2592\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend chapter 25 of the laws of 2009, amending the tax law and the\nadministrative code of the city of New York relating to the metropolitan\ncommuter transportation mobility tax,\nand the education law, in relation to the\nimposition of such tax upon and reimbursement thereof to public and\nprivate elementary and secondary schools\n\nPURPOSE:\nProvides for state reimbursement private elementary and secondary\nschools for the cost of metropolitan commuter transportation mobility\ntax payments.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1: Amends Paragraph (i) of subdivision (a) of section 23 of\npart c of chapter 25 of the laws of 2009, amending the tax law and\nthe administrative code of the city of New York relating to the\nmetropolitan commuter transportation mobility tax.\n\nSection 2: Amends Subdivision 1 of section 3609-g of the education\nlaw, as added by section 1 of part D of a chapter of the laws of 2009.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nWhile the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax hurt\nbusinesses and not-for-profits who are required to pay such tax, it\nalso included that non-public and private elementary and secondary\nschools pay the tax while public schools received a reimbursement\nexemption.\n\nThe payroll tax unfairly burdens private, religious and parochial\nschools because while public school systems are reimbursed for the\npayroll tax at the end of the year, private schools operate as\nindependent entities and are responsible for their own payroll tax.\n\nNon-public schools provide a service to all taxpayers and public\nschool systems by relieving them of the burden of educating those\nadditional students. But instead of being rewarded for that enormous\ncontribution, they're targeted by such discriminatory measures as the\nselective MTA bailout and the payroll tax. Therefore, this bill is\nnecessary to correct this inequity. This bill enables all non-public\nand private elementary and secondary schools to be entitled to the\nsame reimbursements as public school districts.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nNew Bill.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nEstimated reduction in revenues of $6.5 million.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
