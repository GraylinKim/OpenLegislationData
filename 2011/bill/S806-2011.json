THIELE -- read once and referred\n         to the Committee on Local Governments\n\n       AN ACT to amend the town law, in relation to authorizing  certain  towns\n         in  the  Peconic Bay region to establish community housing opportunity\n         funds, provided that such towns adopt a housing plan adhering to smart\n         growth principles in conjunction with the creation of  such  community\n         housing opportunity fund\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Legislative findings. The  legislature  hereby  finds  that\n    2  chapter  114  of  the laws of 1998 enacted provisions of law relating to\n    3  Peconic Bay region community preservation funds. Such chapter  permitted\n    4  the  five  towns of the Peconic Bay region to establish a dedicated fund\n    5  for the acquisition of interests in real property for  the  purposes  of\n    6  open  space,  farmland,  and  historic preservation, as well as park and\n    7  recreation purposes. The revenue for such fund was derived  from  a  two\n    8  percent  real  estate transfer tax. Community preservation funds in each\n    9  of the five Peconic Bay region towns  were  approved  overwhelmingly  by\n   10  public referendum.\n   11    The  enactment  of  this  land  preservation  has  been  an incredible\n   12  success.  The funds have generated over one hundred million  dollars  as\n   13  of July 2002, resulting in thousands of acres of land being protected on\n   14  eastern  Long  Island. The program has received national recognition for\n   15  its innovative and creative approach to community preservation.\n   16    Just as critical to the future of the Peconic Bay region is the  human\n   17  need  to protect community stability by providing for an adequate supply\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD03745-01-1\n\n       S. 806                              2                             A. 528\n\n    1  of community housing opportunities for all segments of the  Peconic  Bay\n    2  community. One of the great paradoxes of the Peconic Bay regional econo-\n    3  my  is  that  the  number of housing units in the Peconic Bay region has\n    4  increased from 38,000 in 1960 to more than 84,000 today. Yet, the avail-\n    5  ability  of  affordable  housing  opportunities  for moderate income and\n    6  working class residents is in critically short supply.\n    7    The adverse impacts from this shortage of  housing  opportunities  are\n    8  critical.  For  example,  local  employers  have  difficulty  hiring and\n    9  retaining employees because of housing  costs  and  availability.  Local\n   10  volunteer  emergency services agencies experience difficulty in recruit-\n   11  ment and retention. Long time residents are forced to  leave  the  area.\n   12  Traffic congestion is exacerbated by the importation of labor from areas\n   13  with  lower  housing  costs.  Other  land  uses such as motels are being\n   14  converted to emergency and permanent housing.    Finally,  the  lack  of\n   15  affordable  housing  is  resulting  in residents being forced to live in\n   16  substandard, illegal conditions.\n   17    Unique demographics and economics in the Peconic  Bay  region,  and  a\n   18  lack  of  affordable dwelling units, are creating this housing shortage.\n   19  The combination of the Peconic Bay region's attractiveness, proximity to\n   20  the dense population of the New York metropolitan region, and  proximity\n   21  to  that  region's  extraordinary wealth, makes the Peconic Bay region a\n   22  prime location for seasonal and luxury homes.\n   23    While this combination of extraordinary attractiveness, population and\n   24  wealth has created a strong local economy for the Peconic Bay region, it\n   25  has resulted in housing problems for local families. In the Peconic  Bay\n   26  region,  37 percent of all housing units are seasonal. The population of\n   27  the region increases from 125,000 to more than 320,000 during the summer\n   28  season.\n   29    In summary, the demand of land  for  luxury  and  seasonal  homes  and\n   30  seasonal  rentals  has  left a short supply of housing opportunities for\n   31  moderate income and working  class  local  residents.  The  Peconic  Bay\n   32  region  needs  a balanced housing policy where there exists a variety of\n   33  housing types and opportunities across the region's economic spectrum.\n   34    The Peconic Bay region requires the  same  creativity,  planning,  and\n   35  community  consensus that resulted in the community preservation fund in\n   36  order to address the issue of housing  opportunity.  Further,  increased\n   37  housing  opportunities  must  be accomplished in the context of rational\n   38  long term planning.\n   39    It is the purpose of this legislation, to give the towns of the Pecon-\n   40  ic Bay region the authority and resources needed to establish  community\n   41  housing  opportunities. Specifically, this legislation would permit each\n   42  town to establish a dedicated  community  housing  opportunity  fund  to\n   43  increase  housing  opportunities  in  the  region.  Such  fund  shall be\n   44  financed by a combination of state and  local  funds.  Further,  a  town\n   45  housing plan adhering to smart growth principles would be required to be\n   46  approved  and implemented to insure that these new housing opportunities\n   47  are enacted in the context of a comprehensive plan. The  fund  shall  be\n   48  enacted by local law subject to a mandatory referendum.\n   49    S  2.  This  act  shall  be known and may be cited as the \"Peconic Bay\n   50  region community housing opportunity act\".\n   51    S 3. The town law is amended by adding a new section 64-k to  read  as\n   52  follows:\n   53    S  64-K.  PECONIC  BAY  REGION COMMUNITY HOUSING OPPORTUNITY FUND.  1.\n   54  DEFINITIONS.
