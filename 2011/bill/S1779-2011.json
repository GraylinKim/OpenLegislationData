  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1779\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the general business law and the penal law,\nin relation to the lawful sale of\nscrap copper and other metals by junk dealers\n\nPURPOSE OF BILL:\n\nThis bill would: (1) impose stricter regulations on salvage dealers\nand scrap metal processors who purchase scrap metals; (2) amend the\npenalties for scrap metal dealers and scrap metal sellers who engage\nin illegal transactions in violation of these provisions;\nand (3) recognize that when thieves who steal property from an owner\ncause damage to the owner's property, the value of the owner's loss\nincludes both the property taken and the incidental damage caused to\nthe property.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nSection 1 of the bill would amend General Business Law (GBL) &sect; 62 to\nrequire salvage dealers to obtain a copy of a government-issued\nidentification card from the seller of scrap metals, and would\nrequire sellers to provide written verification of their authority to\nsell such scrap metal.\n\nSection 2 of the bill would make a conforming change to GBL &sect; 63 to\nensure that dealers segregate purchased scrap metal for the\nstatutorily required 5-day period.\n\nSection 3 of the bill would add a new GBL &sect; 63-b to restrict the sale\nof certain items, including street signs, propane containers for\nfueling forklifts, funeral markers or any metal items bearing\nmarkings of a governmental entity, utility company, cemetery or\nrailroad.\n\nSection 4 of the bill would amend GBL &sect; 64 to provide that if a\nsalvage dealer or his or her employee or agent has three or more\nconvictions for violating GBL &sect;&sect; 62, 63 or 63-b in a 10-year period,\nany subsequent conviction shall be for a class E felony. It also\nprovides that a seller's violation of these provisions would be a\nviolation subject to a $100 fine, unless the violation is\nintentional, in which case it would be a misdemeanor.\n\nSections 5, 6 and 7 of the bill would make similar amendments to GBL\n&sect;&sect; 69-e, 69-g and 69-h to impose on scrap metal processors\nrequirements for a government-issued identification and\nrecord-keeping and prohibitions on the sale of certain items. Section\n7 also would add a new GBL &sect; 69-j, to provide that the provisions of\nArticle 6-c would\npreempt any local law that directly conflicted with it, and that New\nYork City's local law 50 of 2007, which prohibits the unauthorized\npick up of recyclables left at the curb, does not directly conflict\nwith this article.\n\n\nSections 8 and 9 of the bill would add a new definition of \"incidental\ndamage\" to Penal Law &sect; 155.00, to mean property damage, loss of\nincome and loss of profit, and would add a new definition of \"value\"\nto Penal Law &sect; 155.20, to provide that when property is stolen and\nincidental damage caused to other property, the value of the theft is\ndetermined by adding both the value of the property taken and the\nvalue of the incidental damage.\n\nSection 10 of the bill contains the effective date.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\n\nUnder GBL Article 6, a salvage dealer must: (1) obtain and file in his\nor her records and with law enforcement officials, a statement from a\nseller of scrap metals that contains certain information regarding\nthe identity of the seller and the circumstances surrounding the\nseller's acquisition of the metal; and (2) separately store purchased\nmetals for five days, tagging the pile with information as to the\nidentity of the seller.\nAny violation of the provisions in Article 6 by a dealer, or any false\nstatement made in the seller's statement or on a dealer's tag, is a\nmisdemeanor which, in addition to other penalties, could result in\nthe dealer losing his or her license.\n\nGBL Article 6-c contains similar provisions governing transactions by\nscrap metal processors.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\nIn 2008, the Legislature passed similar legislation (S.4029-D\n(Volker)/A.6250-D (Peoples)), which the Governor was constrained to\nveto (Veto number 157 of 2008).\n\n2009-10:  S.6035 Referred to Consumer Protection; Reported to Codes\n\nSTATEMENT IN SUPPORT:\n\nIn 2008, there was a spike in thefts of metals from vacant buildings\nand construction sites (electrical wires and plumbing pipes),\ncemeteries (grave markers) and other locations, by thieves who would\nresell the stolen metals to salvage yards for recycling. The Division\nof Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) reported, for example, that\nRochester saw an approximately 15 percent increase in burglaries from\n2007 to 2008, and that nearly 16 percent of all burglaries in\nRochester were associated with copper theft. Law enforcement\nofficials in other counties reported that they have had reports of\ncopper theft on a daily basis.\n\nThis increase in thefts appears to be the result of record high metal\nprices. For example, copper prices increased nationally by 160\npercent between March 2005 and April 2006.\n\nThis bill addresses this problem in several ways.\n\nFirst, the bill would make amendments to GBL &sect;&sect; 62, 63, 63-b, 69-e,\n69-g, and 69-h that more strictly regulate the procedures for the\nsale of scrap metal to dealers and scrap processors, by requiring\n\n\nmore and better information from sellers as to their identity and\ntheir authority to sell the items to the scrap dealers. These\nprovisions will assist law enforcement in locating and prosecuting\nthe seller in the event that the metals are found to have been stolen.\n\nSecond, the bill also would add new GBL &sect;&sect; 63-b and 69-h, which are\nidentical to the provisions in A.4029-D/A.6250-D, to prohibit the\nsale of certain types of metal products, except by authorized\nemployees. These provisions will help dry up the illegal market for\ncertain types of metals that deserve special protection, such as\nstreet signs, cemetery markers and government property.\n\nThird, the bill would impose increased criminal penalties on scrap\ndealers who repeatedly violate the provisions of GBL &sect;&sect; 62,63 or\n63-b. As under current law, a first, second or third violation would\nbe a misdemeanor which, in addition to other penalties, could result\nin the loss of the dealer's license. For a fourth offense, the\nviolation would be punishable as a class E felony.\n\nFor sellers, a violation of GBL Article 6 would be a misdemeanor if\ncommitted intentionally and would otherwise be a violation. However,\nin order to ensure that the thieves who steal the property are\nproperly punished - and to help deter future thefts criminal\npenalties would be enhanced by amending the definition of \"value\" in\nthe larceny statute to include not only the value of the property\ntaken, but also the value of the incidental damage caused by the\ntheft. Thus, for example, if a thief stole pipes or wires from a\nconstruction site that were valued at $500, but caused more than $500\ndamage to the site, he or she could be charged with Grand Larceny in\nthe Fourth Degree under Penal Law &sect; 155.30(1), rather than Petit\nLarceny, because the value of the property exceeds $1000. If the\nincidental damage exceeded $2500, he or she could be charged with\nGrand Larceny in the Third Degree under Penal Law &sect; 155.35. As has\nbeen recognized, when such thefts occur, it is frequently the case\nthat the collateral damage caused to the structure far exceeds the\nactual cost of the materials that are stolen. This bill would\nrecognize that consequence and appropriately punish, and deter,\nfuture thefts.\n\nBUDGET IMPLICATIONS:\n\nThis bill would have no State fiscal impact.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis bill would take effect 90 days after it is signed into law.\n\n",
