  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2472\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the education law, in relation to a corrective action plan\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo allow licensed trade and business schools an opportunity to present\nand implement a corrective action plan upon the Commissioner's\nfinding of violations of Article 101 of the Education Law or\nregulations promulgated thereunder.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nThis bill adds a new subsection (e) to Section 5003(1) of the\nEducation Law. Section (e)(1) provides that the commissioner will\nallow a school where a violation has occurred to remedy the violation\nthrough development and implementation of a corrective action plan,\nunless the commissioner pursues an expedited proceeding to prevent\nthis. The school will be given a minimum of six months to correct the\nviolation. The section establishes a probationary period that would\nautomatically apply if the school's license has expired before the\nfindings of violations are communicated in writing to the school.\nSection (e)(2) provides the mechanism for an expedited proceeding\nthat the commissioner can use if the Department wishes to deny the\nopportunity to develop and implement a corrective action plan.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nThis bill would institute a small shift in the power equation in\nsituations where the Bureau of Proprietary School Supervision\n(\"Bureau\") denies a school an opportunity to develop and implement a\ncorrective action plan. Presently, when this occurs, the Bureau then\ndenies license renewal and the school must cease to operate. This\nbill makes the opportunity to present a corrective action plan the\ndefault position, while creating a short 30-day mechanism for the\nBureau to contest this in front of an impartial hearing officer\nappointed by the commissioner.\nThe decision would, not be appealable. If SED makes its case by clear\nand convincing evidence, and the school is unable to rebut the SED\nposition, the school would be forced to close. There would at least\nbe some semblance of a due process hearing.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nImmediately upon becoming law.\n\n",
