  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1718\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the environmental conservation law, in relation to prohibiting\nthe establishment or conversion of medical waste treatment, storage,\ntransfer or disposal facilities within one-half\nmile of any residential area,\nprohibiting the issuance of permits to such facilities, and providing\nfor the annual review of permits issued to previously-existing medical\nwaste treatment, storage, transfer or disposal facilities located\nwithin one mile of any residential area\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nTo limit the health risks associated with medical waste transfer\nstation by ensuring that they do not operate in close proximity to\ndensely populated areas.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThis bill amends the environmental conservation law by adding a new\nsubdivision 4 to read as follows: 4a(i) no facility providing for the\nstorage, transportation, treatment or disposal of regulated medical\nwaste shall be constructed within any area within the state which is\nnot zoned for use by such facility or in any area which is within\none half mile of a residential zoned area located within the state.\n(ii) no existing facility located within the state shall be converted\nto a facility providing for the storage, transportation, treatment or\ndisposal of regulated medical waste unless the facility is located in\nan area zoned for use by such facility and such area is not within\none half mile of a residential area located within the state.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThere are many facilities that process regulated medical waste\nthroughout the State of New York. Although these facilities are\nneeded to manage this extremely hazardous type of waste, it is our\nresponsibility to ensure that they are not operating in areas that\nare in close proximity to residential homes which could pose a health\nrisk to the citizens of this state. Research has found. that medic.a1\nwaste transfer stations can cause health risk when located near\nresidential areas.\n\nFor example in New York City, in the Southern part of the Bronx, where\nsuch a facility exist, residents have suffered greatly from being in\nclose proximity to this kind of facility. According to a study\nconducted by New York University's School of Medicine and Robert F.\nWagner Graduate School of Public Service, the waste stations in the\nSouth Bronx community are directly related to the overall poor health\nof that area's residents.\nSpecifically the residents in that area suffer from a higher rate of\nlung and prostate cancer than any other community in the New York\nCity area. In addition, the rate of asthma amongst the children in\n\nthat area is five times higher than among children in other\ncommunities in New York City. The study makes a direct correlation\nbetween the many health issues faced by the residents of the community\nand the operation of the medical waste stations in that area. This\nlegislation will ensure that citizens are not exposed to the siting\nof these potentially dangerous facilities in close proximity to their\nhomes.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n02/25/09 REFERRED TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION\n01/06/10 REFERRED TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to the State.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
