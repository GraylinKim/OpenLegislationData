Legislative findings. The legislature  hereby  acknowledges\n    2  that child abuse is a continuing societal problem in the state affecting\n    3  at  least  80,000  children  each  year. In recent years, there has been\n    4  research on the long-term effects of child abuse on  the  individual  as\n    5  well as society. The vast majority of research has demonstrated that the\n    6  consequences  of  child  abuse  are grave, damaging and often spill over\n    7  into a person's adult life. Adverse  effects  have  been  identified  in\n    8  maltreated children's physical, cognitive, emotional and social develop-\n    9  ment.\n   10    Furthermore,  the  legislature finds that the failure to address child\n   11  abuse through preventive measures not only harms a million children each\n   12  year in this country, it imposes a tremendous cost to society. Like most\n   13  states, New York spends  a  considerable  amount  of  fiscal  and  human\n   14  resources  to  treat  the  numerous  consequences  of  child  abuse  and\n   15  maltreatment. The failure to invest in prevention results in  a  signif-\n   16  icantly greater amount of resources needed to treat the outcomes.\n   17    S  2.  A temporary state commission, to be known as the \"commission of\n   18  child abuse prevention\", is hereby established to examine, evaluate  and\n   19  make  recommendations  concerning  child abuse prevention efforts in the\n   20  state. The commission shall consider the need for additional legislation\n   21  as well as a  stable  source  of  funding  for  child  abuse  prevention\n   22  programs.  Specific  issues  to  be  addressed  by  the commission shall\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD04277-01-1\n\n       S. 2163                             2\n\n    1  include home visitation programs and screening for families at  risk  of\n    2  child maltreatment.\n    3    S 3. The commission shall consist of thirteen members, to be appointed\n    4  as follows: three members to be appointed by the governor; three members\n    5  to  be appointed by the temporary president of the senate; three members\n    6  to be appointed by the speaker  of  the  assembly;  two  members  to  be\n    7  appointed  by  the  minority leader of the senate; and two members to be\n    8  appointed by the minority leader of the assembly. The members shall have\n    9  demonstrated expertise in and experience with the field of  child  abuse\n   10  prevention.  A chairperson and vice-chairperson of such commission shall\n   11  be elected by the majority of its members, all members being present.\n   12    S 4.

Such\n   17  commission  may  meet  and hold public and/or private hearings within or\n   18  without the state, and shall  have  all  the  powers  of  a  legislative\n   19  committee pursuant to the legislative law.\n   20    S  6.  For the accomplishment of its purposes, the commission shall be\n   21  authorized and empowered to undertake any studies, inquiries, surveys or\n   22  analyses it may deem relevant in cooperation with or by  agreement  with\n   23  any other public or private agency.\n   24    S 7. The commission shall make a report of its findings, including any\n   25  recommendations  for  legislative  action  as  it may deem necessary and\n   26  appropriate, to the governor, the temporary president of the senate  and\n   27  the  speaker  of the assembly no later than one year after the effective\n   28  date of this act.\n   29    S 8.

  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2163\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto establish a temporary state commission to study child abuse\nprevention and make recommendations for the implementation of child\nabuse prevention programs across the state;\nand providing for the repeal of such provisions upon\nexpiration thereof\n\nPURPOSE:\nEstablish a state commission to study child abuse\nprevention and make recommendations to the Governor and Legislature.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1: It is acknowledged that child abuse\nis a continuing problem in New York State and impacts at least\n80,000 children each year. The Legislature finds that the failure to\naddress child abuse through preventive measures imposes a tremendous\ncost to society.\n\nSection 2: The \"commission of child abuse prevention\" is established.\n\nSection 3: Provides that the commission shall consist of thirteen\nmembers, to be appointed as follows: three members by the Governor;\nthree members by the Temporary President of the Senate; three by the\nSpeaker of the Assembly; two by the Minority Leader of the senate;\nand two by the Minority Leader of the Assembly. The appointed members\nmust have demonstrated\nexpertise in and experience with the field of child abuse prevention.\nThe chairperson and vice-chairperson shall be elected by a majority\nof the members of the commission.\n\nSection 4: The members of the commission shall receive no compensation\nbut are allowed reimbursement for expenses.\n\nSection 5: The commission is allowed to utilize personnel for the\npurposes of its functions and possess the powers of a legislative\ncommittee.\n\nSection 6: The commission may undertake studies, inquiries, surveys or\nanalyses in cooperation with or by agreement with any other public or\nprivate agency.\n\nSection 7: The commission is required to make a report of its findings\nto the Governor and legislative leaders within one year after the\neffective date of this act.\n\nSection 8: Establishes an effective date\n\nEXISTING LAW:\n\nNone.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nApproximately 1,300 children die each year in this\ncountry as a result of child abuse and neglect and many others\nreceive serious injuries. In New York State, approximately 80,000\nchildren are found to be maltreated each year.\n\nChild abuse and neglect has been rising across the State and more\nresources are expended to treat the consequences including\nincarceration, court costs, foster care and more. A study by Prevent\nChild Abuse New York estimated these costs to be approximately $2.4\nBillion each year, while the amount spent on primary prevention is\nless that $30 million.\n\nTragic cases of child abuse are reported in the press on a regular\nbasis and while these reports focus on the most horrific cases, most\ncases of child abuse are preventable. These cases range from severe\nneglect to the explosive shaking of a crying baby.\n\nResearch has demonstrated that programs focusing on education and\ntraining of future and new parents are the most practical and\ncost-effective means for preventing child abuse and neglect.\nEffective prevention programs that promote the safety and well-being\nof children and families can reduce the suffering of children, assist\nparents in developing better parenting skills and reduce the economic\ncosts to society. The total financial costs of child abuse and\nneglect are quite high, but the benefits or savings from investing in\nprevention programs also are quite high.\n\nMany prevention programs address not only child abuse prevention but\nother aspects of family dynamics that threaten child and family\nwell-being. These threats include preventable health conditions such\nas low birth weight, infant mortality, drug-addicted babies and more.\nThese programs often provide referrals, education, expertise, and\nmost importantly stability for at-risk families.\n\nWhile a number of these preventive programs have proven to be both\nbeneficial and cost-effective, they are currently only offered to a\nsmall number of families at risk of abuse and neglect. For example,\nhome visitation is only available to about 10% to 14% of eligible\nfamilies.\n\nBy studying the availability of successful prevention programs and the\nbest way to expand their services to more families at risk, we can\nsave numerous children from having to endure abuse and neglect while.\nsaving the state considerable fiscal resources.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.7514 of 2010 - Referred to Finance\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nImmediately, with provisions.\n\n",
