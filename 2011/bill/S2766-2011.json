  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2766\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the education law, in relation to the profession of nurse\nanesthesia\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nThis act codifies the profession of\nnurse anesthesia as a specialty of the profession of nursing.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nAmends section 6902 of the education\nlaw by adding a new subdivision 4 which sets ,out the definition of\ncertified registered nurse anesthetists, and adds section 6911\nregarding the education and training of nurse anesthetists.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nCurrently, New York State law does not codify the\npractice of nurse anesthesia. Instead, the scope of this practice has\nbeen defined through educational requirements and Health Department\nregulations.\n\nExisting requirements for training, education, and certification of\ncertified register nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) have resulted in high\nquality, professional care by CRNAs. Statutory codification would\nresolve problems relating to liability, supervision, and authority to\nadminister anesthesia.\n\nThis legislation was developed with the support of the New York state\nAssociation of Nurse Anesthetists.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2003-04: A.5021-A - Referred to Higher Education Committee\n2005-06: A.4015-A - Referred to Higher Education Committee\n2007-08: A.5201   - Referred to Higher Education Committee\n2009-10: S.2388/A.1727 (Gottfried) - Referred to Higher Education\nCommittee and then Committed to Rules\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
