DESTITO,  PRETLOW, SPANO, KAVANAGH, LANCMAN,\n         DenDEKKER, SCHROEDER, JEFFRIES --  Multi-Sponsored  by  --  M.  of  A.\n         AUBRY,  COOK,  CYMBROWITZ,  ENGLEBRIGHT,  FARRELL, GALEF, GLICK, GOTT-\n         FRIED,  HEASTIE,  HEVESI,   JACOBS,   LATIMER,   MAYERSOHN,   MILLMAN,\n         O'DONNELL,  TOWNS, WEISENBERG, WRIGHT -- read once and referred to the\n         Committee on Governmental Operations\n\n       AN ACT to amend the civil rights law, in relation to  discrimination  in\n         the ownership of cooperative housing\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Legislative findings and declaration of intent. The  legis-\n    2  lature  recognizes  that cooperative ownership in multi-family dwellings\n    3  is a popular form of home  ownership  in  New  York  state.  An  ongoing\n    4  concern  for  consumers dealing in the cooperative housing market is the\n    5  potential for the unlawful rejection by a board of directors of a buyer.\n    6    The legislature finds and determines that, not infrequently,  a  co-op\n    7  board  rejects  what appears to be a well-qualified customer. Often, the\n    8  prospective purchaser has concerns that the rejection was in fact unlaw-\n    9  ful discrimination. Both federal and state  laws  protect  our  citizens\n   10  from  unfair  housing practices, which include discrimination based upon\n   11  race, ethnicity, gender, age or family status.\n   12    For such reasons, it is the legislature's intent to require boards  of\n   13  directors of cooperative housing to disclose to proposed purchasers, the\n   14  reasons for rejecting a sale.\n   15    S 2.  Section 19-a of the civil rights law, as added by chapter 376 of\n   16  the laws of 1971, is amended to read as follows:\n   17    S  19-a.    Prohibition  against  unreasonable withholding of consent.\n   18  WHENEVER ANY CORPORATION FORMED  FOR  THE  PURPOSE  OF  THE  COOPERATIVE\n   19  OWNERSHIP  OF REAL ESTATE WITHIN THE STATE WITHHOLDS CONSENT TO THE SALE\n   20  OR PROPOSED SALE OF CERTIFICATES OF STOCK OR OTHER EVIDENCE OF OWNERSHIP\n   21  OF AN INTEREST IN SUCH CORPORATION, SUCH CORPORATION SHALL  PROVIDE  THE\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD06151-01-1\n\n       A. 2383                             2\n\n    1  PROSPECTIVE  PURCHASER WITH A WRITTEN STATEMENT OF ITS REASONS FOR WITH-\n    2  HOLDING CONSENT NO LATER THAN FIVE BUSINESS DAYS AFTER ITS  DECISION  TO\n    3  WITHHOLD CONSENT.\n    4    1.  No  SUCH  corporation  [formed  for the purpose of the cooperative\n    5  ownership of real estate within the state]  shall  withhold  [its]  SUCH\n    6  consent  [to the sale or proposed sale of certificates of stock or other\n    7  evidence of ownership of an interest in such corporation] because of the\n    8  race, creed, national origin, or sex of the purchaser.\n    9    2. For the purposes of this section a \"corporation\" shall include  the\n   10  cooperative  management,  cooperative tenants, cooperative shareholders,\n   11  or any appointee or successor in interest of a corporation.\n   12    3. This section shall apply to every sale or proposed sale whether  by\n   13  a  corporation  directly,  its  successor  in  interest, or by any other\n   14  lawfully entitled party.\n   15    4. Every agreement, negative covenant, restrictive covenant  or  other\n   16  provision,  whether written or oral and wherever contained, inconsistent\n   17  with this section shall be void and unenforceable.\n   18    S 3. This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day  after  it  shall\n   19  have become a law.\n",
