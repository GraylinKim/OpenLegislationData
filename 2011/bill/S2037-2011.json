  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2037\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the education law, in relation to requiring the presence of\na person certified in\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation in school buildings being attended by\npupils\n\nSUMMARY OF BILL:\nAmends the Education Law by adding a new Section 920-a\nrequiring school districts to provide adequate personnel certified in\nCPR in each school building being attended by pupils in numbers\ndetermined by the Commissioner of Education to be sufficient. It\nrequires that such person successfully complete the basic life\nsupport course conducted by the American Heart Association or the\nAmerican Red Cross or other program certified by the Commissioner of\nEducation. It also requires that the names of certified individuals\nbe posted and available to all employees and pupils.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nRecent statistics indicate that each year nearly one\nmillion Americans suffer heart attacks and more than one half of them\n(nearly 650,000) die before reaching a hospital or receiving medical\ntreatment. This bill would ensure that adequate personnel in each\nschool building be equipped with this expertise to provide students\nand staff with an extra margin of safety. With increased public\nknowledge of lifesaving techniques and emergency medical services,\nschool personnel should be properly trained to deal with medical\nemergencies involving students or faculty. Failure to provide\nappropriate care has resulted in at least two lawsuits against school\ndistricts.\n\nEFFECTS OF PRESENT LAW WHICH THIS BILL WOULD ALTER:\nThe Education Law does not address this issue.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the first of September\nnext succeeding the date on which it shall have become a law.\n\n",
