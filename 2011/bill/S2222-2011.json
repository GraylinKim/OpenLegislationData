  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2222\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the general obligations law, in relation to certain covenants\nand restrictions limiting religious expression being void as against\npublic policy\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nGrants people the right to temporarily or seasonally display symbols\nof religion or heritage on their property.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThis legislation amends the general obligations law by adding a new\nsection 5-336. The new section would declare void as against public\npolicy any promise, covenant or restriction in a contract, mortgage,\nlease deed or conveyance or in any other agreement affecting real\nproperty, heretofore or hereafter made or entered into, which\nlimits, restrains, prohibits or otherwise provides against the\nfreedom of religious expression including the temporary or seasonal\ndisplay of symbols with religious significance by the owner, lessee\nor occupant of the real property.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nRecently it has become evident that groups such as property owner\nassociations have attempted via the inclusion of restrictive\ncovenants to homebuyers, to limit what people put on their property.\nCertain religions have their followers place symbols of their faith\nand religious heritage on their property surrounding their home. This\nlegislation attempts to protect people's religious freedoms and their\nrituals and practices that go along with actively celebrating their\nfaith. Structures protected by this bill would include outdoor\nsymbols such as nativity sets and sukkah huts.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
