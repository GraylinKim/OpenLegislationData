  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2521\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the vehicle and traffic law, in relation to establishing a\ndistinctive plate honoring the one hundredth anniversary of the Boy\nScouts of America\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo establish a distinctive license plate\nhonoring the 100th\nanniversary of the Boy Scouts of America.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThis bill adds a new section 404-x to the vehicle and traffic law that\nwould authorize the creation of distinctive \"Boy Scouts of America\"\nlicense plates. It would require an additional annual service charge\nof twenty-five dollars per each set of plates issued. The initial\nservice charges collected by the department of motor vehicles in\nexcess of six thousand dollars would be paid on a quarterly basis to\nthe National Council of the Boy Scouts of America for deposit into\nthe World Friendship Fund of the Boy Scouts of America.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe Boy Scouts of America was founded in 1910 by William D. Boyce\nand received a Congressional Charter in 1916. The people of the\nState of New York immediately embraced the organization and were\namong the first to establish local councils. In fact, long Island is\nthe home of America's first Eagle Scout, Arthur Eldred. There are\napproximately 270,000 young men and women and 55,000 adult volunteers\nwho are a part of the Boy Scouts of America in New York State. This\nlegislation would create distinctive \"Boy Scouts of America\" license\nplates that would allow vehicle owners to show their support for the\norganization. The revenue generated by the issuance of these plates\nwould be deposited into the \"World Friendship Fund\" of Scouting for\nthe purpose of funding cooperative projects that bring scouts\ntogether from all over the world.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-10: S.2158 - Referred to Transportation\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nMinimal.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis Act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
