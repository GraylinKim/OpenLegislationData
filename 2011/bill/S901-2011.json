Legislative intent.  Cigarette filters do not decompose and\n    2  return to the soil.  Consequently they produce unsightly litter as  well\n    3  as posing a possible threat to any water system that they may be flushed\n    4  into,  through  plumbing  or  natural drainage. It is the intent of this\n    5  legislation to improve the quality of life by removing  the  litter  and\n    6  reducing  the  danger  of  possible chemical reaction through the use of\n    7  biodegradable filters.\n    8    S 2. The environmental conservation law is amended  by  adding  a  new\n    9  section 27-0721 to read as follows:\n   10  S 27-0721. FILTERS ON CIGARETTES TO BE BIODEGRADABLE.\n   11    1.  WITHIN  TWO  YEARS  AFTER  THE  EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, NO\n   12  FILTERED CIGARETTES SHALL BE SOLD OR OFFERED  FOR  SALE  IN  THIS  STATE\n   13  UNLESS  THE MANUFACTURER THEREOF HAS CERTIFIED IN WRITING TO THE DEPART-\n   14  MENT THAT THE FILTER IS BIODEGRADABLE.\n   15    2.  A VIOLATION OF THIS SECTION SHALL BE PUNISHABLE BY A CIVIL PENALTY\n   16  NOT TO EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR EACH VIOLATION THEREOF.\n   17    S 3. This act shall take effect immediately.\n\n\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD04076-01-1\n",
