  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2210\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to establishing the crimes of\nattempting to lure or entice a child\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 135.17 to the Penal Law to provide that a person is guilty of\nthe crime of attempting to lure or entice a child, a class D felony,\nwhen he or she being 18 years of age or older (a) attempts to lure or\nentice a child who is less than 17 years old into a vehicle, building or\nother isolated area for the purposes of committing a criminal offense;\nor (b) with the intent to lure or harass, by means of a computer\ncommunication, communicates with a person he or she knows (or reasonably\nshould know) is less than 17 years of age, in order to solicit a sexual\nencounter or to commit a criminal offense with or against.\n\nThis bill specifically states that this section shall not be deemed to\npreclude a charge of attempted kidnapping.\n\nPURPOSE AND JUSTIFICATION:\nTo protect the\nchildren of this State from those predators who attempt to lure or\nentice them either by means of a computer or into a vehicle or a secluded\narea so that they can do them harm.\n\nCurrently, any person who attempts to lure or entice a child into a\nsecluded area for illegal purposes is charged with endangering the\nwelfare of a child which is only a class A misdemeanor. This bill would\nenhance the penalties by making it a class D felony. While there are\nseveral crimes that address the criminal acts which take place after the\nchild has actually been lured away, this bill would focus on and\nseverely punish those who attempt to do so.\n\nCurrent law does not specifically address the harassment of a child via\ncomputer. As children increasingly use computers for a variety of\nreasons, all too often they are harassed by predators who use computers\nto initiate sexual encounters. In one particular case that received\nnational attention, a nine year old child's neighbor posted her name and\ntelephone number on the internet for others to solicit sex from her.\nThis bill would codify this relatively new and horrendous act, making it\na class D felony.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009/10 - S.2106/A.1626 - Codes\n2007/08 - S.1761/A.9708 - Passed Senate/Codes\n2005/06 - S.1517/A.7554 - Passed Senate/Codes\n2004 -    S.3845-A/A.1520-B - Passed Senate/Codes\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone noted.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS\nNone noted.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the\nfirst of November next succeeding the date on which it shall have\nbecome law.\n\n",
