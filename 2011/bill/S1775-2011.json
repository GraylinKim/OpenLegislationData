  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1775\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the multiple dwelling law, in relation to the collection of\ncharges for heat-related residential utility service\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL::\nThis bill would amend section 79 of\nthe Multiple Dwelling Law to eliminate the practice of building\nowners charging residential rental tenants for electricity, natural\ngas, and other fuel used for space heating in the dwelling unit.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS::\nSubdivision 1 of section 79 of the\nmultiple dwelling law is amended to prohibit an owner or agent of any\nowner from separately charging tenants or occupants for any\nelectricity, electric service, natural gas or natural gas service or\nother fuel utilized to heat living quarters.\n\nJUSTIFICATION::\nShifting heating costs to tenants reduces economic\nincentives for landlords to improve the thermal efficiency of their\nstructures, through measures such as insulation, window replacement\nwith high efficiency glass, and provide more efficient heating\nsystems, fixtures, and smart controls. This is contrary to state\npolicy to promote energy efficiency and to reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions.\n\nAs utility costs rise, some building owners have begun to shift their\ncosts for fuel and electricity onto their tenants, by requiring\ntenants to pay heating surcharges, separate and apart from rent, for\nfuel or electricity used to heat their dwelling units. These\nsurcharges are based on consumption measured by either landlord-owned\nmeters, or based on apartment square footage allocations. These\nsurcharges, typically for natural gas or electricity, are inherently\nunpredictable, are not quantified in tenant leases, and are not\nknowable in advance. As such, they cause great hardship to tenants\nliving on fixed incomes from social security, disability and\npensions, who lack significant savings. Frequently, heating\nsurcharges imposed by owners are not subject to outside audit or\nverification by the tenant and are therefore inherently prone to\nabuse. Shifting building owners' heating costs to tenants through\nunpredictable and continually varying surcharges. renders these costs\nnot transparent to tenants, because owners are not obligated to\nreveal the energy inefficiencies of their buildings or the amount of\nenergy wasted by the heating equipment they operate. In contrast, if\nbuilding owners retain direct responsibility for heating costs,\nthey will recover those costs in the rent they charge and they will\nhave the incentive to adopt cost effective efficiency measures. The\ncharge for rent is fixed and transparent, and can be understood by\nexisting and prospective tenants. The Multiple Dwelling Law already\nimposes upon\nlandlords the obligation to provide heat or heating fixtures to tenants.\n\nThis bill prevents owners of multiple dwellings from imposing charges\nfor natural gas, electricity, or other fuel used for space heating\n\n\nseparate from the stated rent. It does not affect situations where a\ntenant has directly metered gas or electric service from a franchised\ngas corporation or electric corporation.\n\nRequiring tenants to pay surcharges to building owners for fuel and\nelectricity for heating denies them the protections of programs\ndesigned by the legislature to protect low income utility customers\nfrom abuse, such as the Home Energy Fair Practices Act (HEFPA), and\nthe legislatively-created safety nets for the needy including the\nemergency utility assistance program under Social Services Law\n131-s and the energy crisis provisions of the home energy assistance\nprogram under Social Services Law 97 (HEAP). Customer remedies and\nassistance in these programs is triggered by a notice of termination\nof utility service, and is not available when surcharges for heating\ncosts are deemed to be \"added rent,\" allowing landlords to evict\ntenants for nonpayment. Tenants who encounter temporary difficulty in\nmeeting their obligations to pay for fluctuating charges heat-related\nutility service are in a far worse position than direct utility\ncompany over unpaid or disputed charges; they are given the\nopportunity to pay arrears over time in affordable installments\nthrough deferred payment plans, which must be offered as an\nalternative to termination of utility service, and they have the\nopportunity to obtain emergency HEAP or Social Services Law\nsection 131-s assistance. Such assistance is not available when the\nlandlord imposes a rent surcharge for a utility service it provides\nthrough its own meters or for the cost of utility service which the\nlandlord uses to heat the premises and allocates based on square\nfootage or other factors.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY::\n2009-2010:  S.4749 Referred to Housing, Construction & Community\nDevelopment\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS::\nNone is anticipated.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE::\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
