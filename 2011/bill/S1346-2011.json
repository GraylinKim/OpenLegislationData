  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1346\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the general business law, in relation to protecting the rights\nof cell phone users\n\nPURPOSE:\nEliminates charges for the cancellation of an additional phone line and\nallows for the addition of a new phone line without renewing the\noriginal contract.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 of the bill adds a new Section 390-d to the General Business\nLaw, which provides that cell phone service providers cannot cause a\nuser to extend their existing contract simply because they have added an\nadditional line to their current plan. This section also prohibits cell\nphone providers from charging a user for canceling a phone line from\ntheir account, as long as the primary line is kept active.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nNone.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nCell phones have become almost as common as household phones. Most\ncouples and families purchase contracts and add additional lines for\ntheir loved ones, so they can keep in touch. It is often the case that\nlines are added to a customer's existing contract (a child becomes a\nteenager, or a single adult becomes involved in a relationship), and\njust as frequently, lines are canceled (a couple breaks up, or a child\ngraduates college and gets their own phone).\n\nCell phone providers currently charge customers a cancellation fee when\nthey drop an additional line which was added to their primary phone\nline. Similarly, it is standard practice by most cell phone providers to\nrequire that customers, when adding an additional phone line to their\ncontract, cause an automatic renewal of their contract.\n\nThe monthly cost for cell phone service, the additional charges that are\nfrequently incurred, and the length of the cell phone contracts, are all\nquite extensive. Customers should not have to pay for the addition or\nremoval of a line, as long as they maintain their main line.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-10 - S.1079/A.4954 - Passed Senate\n2007/08 - S.1497/A.6996 - Referred to Consumer Protection\n2005/06 - S.8493/A.12081 - Referred to Consumer Affairs & Protection\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
