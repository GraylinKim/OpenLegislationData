  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2596\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to penalties for causing serious\ninjury or death while knowingly operating a motor vehicle with a revoked\nor suspended license\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nTo create two new felony crimes addressing those who cause such\nserious physical injury or death by operation of a motor vehicle\nwhile knowing or having reason to know that his or her license or\nprivilege of operating a motor vehicle is suspended or revoked.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 provides for the amending of Section 120.03 of the Penal\nLaw, as separately amended by Chapters 427 and 805 of the Laws of\n1922 and subdivision 3 as amended by Chapter 529 of the Laws of 1998\nto include the new crime of causing serious physical injury by\noperation of a motor vehicle while knowing or having reason to know\nthat one's license or privilege of operating a motor vehicle is\nsuspended or revoked pursuant to provisions of five hundred ten of\nthe vehicle and Traffic Law, as vehicular assault in the second\ndegree, which is a class E felony.\n\nSection 2 also provides for the amending of Section 125.12 of the\nPenal Law, as separately amended by Chapters 427 and 805 of the Laws\nof 1992 and subdivision 3 as amended by Chapter 529 of the Laws of\n1998 to include the new crime of causing the death of such other\nperson by operation of a motor vehicle while knowing or having reason\nto know that his or her license or privilege of operating a motor\nvehicle is suspended or revoked pursuant to provisions of section\nfive hundred ten of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, as vehicular\nmanslaughter in the second degree, which is a class D felony.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nUnder current law any person who commits vehicular assault, or\nvehicular manslaughter, while operating a motor vehicle while knowing\nor having reason to know that his or her license or privilege of\noperating a motor vehicle is suspended or revoked, pursuant to\nprovisions of section five hundred ten of the vehicle and traffic\nlaw, may not face serious criminal penalties.\n\nThe injuries and tragedies associated with these vehicular accidents\nare ultimately preventable.

Law enforcement must be given the ability to\nprosecute such individuals to make our roadways safer.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n01/25/05  Referred to Codes\n01/04/06  Referred to Codes\n01/17/07  Referred to Codes\n02/09/08  Referred to Codes\n2009/1O:  Referred to Codes\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to the state.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the first of November next succeeding\nthe date on which it shall have become a law.\n\n",
