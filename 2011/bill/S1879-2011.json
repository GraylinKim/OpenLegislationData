It is unjust that the labor\nprotections provided to other workers in New York such as a day of\nrest, overtime pay, disability insurance, unemployment benefits and\ncollective bargaining have been denied to farmworkers for decades.\nThis legislation would grant farmworkers the basic labor rights long\nenjoyed by other public and private employees in our State.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nNew Bill.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to the State.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect upon enactment, provided that section\nfifteen of this act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth\nday after it shall have become a law, and provided further, that\nsections five, eight and nine of this act shall take effect January\n1, 2012.\n\n",
