SAVINO -- read twice and ordered printed, and when\n         printed to be committed to the Committee on Finance\n\n       AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation to the  lupus  educa-\n         tion and outreach program; and making an appropriation therefor\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  the\n    2  following:\n    3    (a)  Lupus is a serious, complex, debilitating autoimmune disease that\n    4  can cause inflammation and tissue damage to virtually any  organ  system\n    5  in  the body, including the skin, joints, other connective tissue, blood\n    6  and blood vessels, heart, lungs, kidney, and brain.\n    7    (b) Lupus research estimates that approximately one and a half to  two\n    8  million Americans live with some form of lupus; lupus affects women nine\n    9  times more often than men and eighty percent of newly diagnosed cases of\n   10  lupus develop among women of childbearing age.\n   11    (c)  Lupus  disproportionately  affects women of color -- it is two to\n   12  three times more common among African-Americans, Hispanics,  Asians  and\n   13  Native Americans and is generally more prevalent in minority populations\n   14  -- a health disparity that remains unexplained. According to the Centers\n   15  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  the  rate of lupus mortality has\n   16  increased since the late 1970s and is higher among older  African-Ameri-\n   17  can women.\n   18    (d) No new drugs have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis-\n   19  tration  specifically  for lupus in nearly forty years and while current\n   20  treatments for the disease can be effective, they can lead  to  damaging\n   21  side effects.\n   22    (e)  The  pain and fatigue associated with lupus can threaten people's\n   23  ability to live independently, make it difficult to maintain  employment\n   24  and  lead normal lives, and one in five people with lupus is disabled by\n   25  the disease, and consequently receives support from government programs,\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD00216-01-1\n\n       S. 1109                             2\n\n    1  including Medicare, Medicaid, social  security  disability,  and  social\n    2  security supplemental income.\n    3    (f)  The  estimated  average  annual  cost of medical treatment for an\n    4  individual with lupus can range between ten thousand dollars and  thirty\n    5  thousand  dollars;  for  people who have the most serious form of lupus,\n    6  medical costs can greatly exceed  this  amount,  causing  a  significant\n    7  economic, emotional and social burden to the entire family and society.\n    8    (g)  More than half of the people with lupus suffer four or more years\n    9  and visit three or more  physicians  before  obtaining  a  diagnosis  of\n   10  lupus;  early  diagnosis  of and commencement of treatment for lupus can\n   11  prevent or reduce serious organ damage, disability, and death.\n   12    (h) Despite the magnitude of lupus and its impact on  individuals  and\n   13  families,  health professional and public understanding of lupus remains\n   14  low; only one of five Americans can provide even basic information about\n   15  lupus, and awareness of lupus is lowest among adults  ages  eighteen  to\n   16  thirty-four -- the age group most likely to develop symptoms of lupus.\n   17    (i)  Lupus  is  a  significant  national  health issue that deserves a\n   18  comprehensive and coordinated response by state and federal  governments\n   19  with involvement of the health care provider, patient, and public health\n   20  communities.\n   21    S  2. Subdivision 1 of section 207 of the public health law is amended\n   22  by adding a new paragraph (i) to read as follows:\n   23    (I) LUPUS, A DEBILITATING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE THAT CAN CAUSE  INFLAMMA-\n   24  TION  AND  TISSUE  DAMAGE  TO  VIRTUALLY  ANY  ORGAN SYSTEM IN THE BODY,\n   25  INCLUDING THE SKIN, JOINTS, OTHER CONNECTIVE  TISSUE,  BLOOD  AND  BLOOD\n   26  VESSELS, HEART, LUNG, KIDNEY AND BRAIN, AND WHICH AFFECTS WOMEN, PARTIC-\n   27  ULARLY  WOMEN  OF COLOR, IN A DISPROPORTIONATE MANNER; PROVIDED THAT THE\n   28  PROGRAM SHALL INCLUDE AN ADVISORY COUNCIL UNDER THIS SECTION THAT  SHALL\n   29  INCLUDE  REPRESENTATIVES  OF  PEOPLE  WITH  LUPUS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND\n   30  HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHO SPECIALIZE IN TREATING LUPUS, AMONG OTHERS.\n   31    S 3. Subdivision 7 of section 207 of the public health law, as amended\n   32  by section 16 of Part A of chapter 109 of the laws of 2010,  is  amended\n   33  to read as follows:\n   34    7.  In  addition  to  state funds appropriated for programs under this\n   35  section, the commissioner may  accept  grants  from  public  or  private\n   36  sources  for  these  programs.  The  commissioner, in administering this\n   37  section, shall seek to coordinate the department's programs  with  other\n   38  public  and  private  programs,  and  may undertake joint or cooperative\n   39  programs with other public or private entities, INCLUDING MAKING  GRANTS\n   40  (WITHIN  AMOUNTS  APPROPRIATED  THEREFOR  AND CONSISTENT WITH APPLICABLE\n   41  LAW) TO PUBLIC OR NOT-FOR-PROFIT ENTITIES.\n   42    S 4. The sum of two hundred fifty thousand dollars  ($250,000.00),  or\n   43  so  much  thereof  as  may  be  necessary, is hereby appropriated to the\n   44  department of health out of any moneys in  the  state  treasury  in  the\n   45  general  fund to the credit of the state purposes account, not otherwise\n   46  appropriated, and made immediately available, for the purpose of  carry-\n   47  ing  out the provisions of this act. Such moneys shall be payable on the\n   48  audit and warrant of the comptroller on vouchers certified  or  approved\n   49  by the commissioner of health in the manner prescribed by law.\n   50    S 5. This act shall take effect immediately.\n",
