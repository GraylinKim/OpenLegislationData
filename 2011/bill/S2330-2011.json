  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2330\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the labor law, in relation to providing low interest loans\nto displaced homemakers and\nmaking an appropriation therefor\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nAmends the labor law by adding 825-a which authorizes the Department\nof Labor to set up a special loan program for displaced homemakers.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe displaced homemaker is faced with a myriad of problems which\nultimately centers around increased financial strain. The\nestablishment of a low interest loan fund would enable them to take\npart in job training and other educational programs which they would\nnot otherwise be able to afford. This is especially important in\ntimes when financial aid is shrinking substantially. The fund, at a\nminimal cost to the state, would serve to: (1) extend job training\nand other educational programs to displaced homemakers with little\nfinancial security; (2) decrease the number of welfare recipients by\nsupplying a means for homemakers in general by allowing the program\nto provide essential aid to carry out its goal.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n1999-2000: S.2437 Died in Committee\n2001-2002: S.2441 Died in Committee\n2003-2004: S.1631 Died in Committee\n2005-2006: S.1495 Died in Committee\n2007-2008: S.4032 Died in Committee\n2008-2009: S.4928 Died in Committee\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nOriginal appropriation of $270,000 to be maintained by the Department\nof Labor. This appropriation would become unnecessary in the future\nas original loans are paid back. The administration of the programs\nwould then be supplemented by the interest of the loans.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the one hundred twentieth day after it\nshall have become a law.\n\n",
