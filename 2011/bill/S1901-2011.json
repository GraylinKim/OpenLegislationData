  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1901\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the administrative code of the city of New York and the\nemergency tenant protection act of nineteen seventy-four, in\nrelation to determining primary residency\n\nSUMMARY:\nThis bill would amend sections 26-403 (e) (2) (i) (10) and 26-504 (a)\n(1) (f) of the New York City Administrative Code and the Emergency\nTenant Protection Act, McKinney's unconsolidated laws &sect; 8625 (a) (10)\nto provide that for purposes of determining primary residency for\nrent control or rent stabilization purposes, the failure to file a\nNew York City or New York State resident income tax return by an\nindividual required by law to file such a return, shall result in a\nfinding that the tenant does not occupy the unit as his or her\nprimary residence.\nThis provision would not apply to tenants who have requested an\nextension of time for payment of tax or where any other factor exists\nwhich would excuse the timely filing of a return.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nSince 1971, premises not occupied as a tenant's primary residence have\nbeen exempt from both rent control and rent stabilization. This\ndecision is made by the courts, on a case-by-case basis, yet the\nstatute provides little or no guidance to the courts, faced with\nmaking this determination. At present, the non-payment of New York\nCity taxes is simply one factor to be taken into account in a\ndetermination of primary residency.\n\nRent control laws are intended to protect those bona fide residents of\nNew York City from its unusual rental market. Certainly, the payment\nof New York City taxes should be a very important consideration in\nthe determination of primary residency.\n\nThis bill would accomplish this by making the non-payment of New York\nCity taxes sufficient to establish a finding that the tenant does not\noccupy the unit as his or her primary residence.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATION:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately, with provisions.\n\n",
