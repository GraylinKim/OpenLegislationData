CUSICK, ORTIZ, TOWNS, PHEFFER -- Multi-Sponsored\n         by -- M. of A.   COLTON, TITONE --  read  once  and  referred  to  the\n         Committee on Governmental Employees\n\n       AN  ACT  to amend the retirement and social security law, in relation to\n         allowing an eligible member of the public retirement system to  obtain\n         service  credit  for  certain  military service if such person has two\n         years of credited service\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section  1. Subdivision 3 of section 1000 of the retirement and social\n    2  security law, as added by chapter 548 of the laws of 2000, is amended to\n    3  read as follows:\n    4    3. A member must have at least [five] TWO years  of  credited  service\n    5  (not  including  service  granted  hereunder)  to be eligible to receive\n    6  credit under this section.\n    7    S 2. This act shall take effect immediately.\n         FISCAL NOTE.--This bill would amend Chapter 548 of the laws of 2000 to\n       allow members who have  at  least  (2)  years  of  credited  service  to\n       purchase  service  credit for military service. Currently a member needs\n       at least five (5) years of credited service to be eligible  to  purchase\n       such service credit.\n         For members that purchase military service credit who ordinarily would\n       not  have attained five years of service credit, the additional military\n       service credit could provide a vested retirement benefit where a retire-\n       ment benefit would not have existed.\n         Insofar as this bill would affect the New York State and Local Employ-\n       ees' Retirement System and the New York State and Local Police and  Fire\n       Retirement System, there will be a cost for such members. Such cost will\n       depend  on  the plan coverage, salary and age of the members who will be\n       receiving an increased benefit. This cost will be shared by the State of\n       New York and all participating employers in the New York State and Local\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD00545-02-1\n\n       A. 2055                             2\n\n       Employees' Retirement System and the New York State and Local Police and\n       Fire Retirement System.\n         This  estimate,  dated  December  17,  2010  and intended for use only\n       during the  2011  Legislative  Session,  is  Fiscal  Note  No.  2011-59,\n       prepared  by  the  Actuary  for  the New York State and Local Employees'\n       Retirement System and the New York  State  and  Local  Police  and  Fire\n       Retirement System.\n",
