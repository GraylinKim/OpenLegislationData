ALESI  -- read twice and ordered printed, and when\n         printed to be committed to the Committee on Higher Education\n\n       AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to the educational prepa-\n         ration for practice of professional nursing\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section  1.  The  legislature  hereby finds and declares that with the\n    2  increasing complexity of the  American  healthcare  system  and  rapidly\n    3  expanding  technology,  the  educational  preparation  of the registered\n    4  professional nurse must be expanded. The nurse of  the  future  must  be\n    5  prepared  to  partner  with  multiple  disciplines as a collaborator and\n    6  manager of the complex patient care journey. Shorter lengths  of  stays,\n    7  higher  patient  acuity,  and more sophisticated technologies and proce-\n    8  dures are increasing the complexity of patient  care  -  which  in  turn\n    9  places  great  demands  on  nursing  competencies.  Other  countries are\n   10  responding to these changes by requiring the baccalaureate degree as  an\n   11  entry  requirement  for  nursing  licensure  while other professions are\n   12  demanding master and doctoral degrees  as  their  entry  point.  Several\n   13  recent  research  studies  clearly  demonstrate the added value of addi-\n   14  tional education in relation to improved  patient  outcomes;  one  study\n   15  demonstrates  that  each ten percent increase in the number of baccalau-\n   16  reate prepared nurses results in a five  percent  decrease  in  surgical\n   17  patient  deaths.  Therefore,  the  legislature  finds that expending the\n   18  educational requirements for the profession of nursing, while  maintain-\n   19  ing the multiple entry points into the profession, is needed.  This bill\n   20  affects  future nurses graduating from associate degree or diploma nurs-\n   21  ing programs who would be required to obtain a baccalaureate in  nursing\n   22  within  ten  years  of initial licensure. All current nurses licensed in\n   23  New York and students in programs preparing for registered  professional\n   24  nursing  are  to be exempt from the new requirement. This legislation is\n   25  mirrored after the progressive education requirement for teachers in New\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD08577-01-1\n\n       S. 2553                             2\n\n    1  York state. Numerous regulatory and accrediting bodies have  recommended\n    2  this  change  as  a  means  to  address sophisticated patient care needs\n    3  resulting from shorter lengths of stay, higher acuity and more sophisti-\n    4  cated  interventions.  This  proposal is the result of a growing body of\n    5  research evidence that additional education results  in  better  patient\n    6  outcomes.  Therefore by requiring the baccalaureate degree for continued\n    7  registration as a registered professional nurse this bill  seeks  to  be\n    8  responsive  to  meet  the  increasingly complex health care needs of the\n    9  residents of New York state.\n   10    S 2.

  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2553\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the education law, in relation to the educational preparation\nfor practice of professional nursing\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo increase the level of education for\ncontinued registration\nas a registered professional nurse ten years after initial licensure\nwhile maintaining the multiple entry points into the profession.\n\nSUMMARY OF LEGISLATION:\nSection 1: The legislature\nhereby finds and\ndeclares that with the increasing complexity of the American health\ncare system and rapidly expanding technology, the educational\npreparation of the registered professional nurse must be expanded.\nConsequently, this bill requires that a baccalaureate degree be\nobtained for the continued registration as a registered professional\nnurse.\n\nSection 2. Subdivision 2 of section 6905 of the education law, as\namended by chapter 994 of the laws of 1971 and as renumbered by\nchapter 50 of the laws of 1972, is amended to read as follows: (2)\nEducation:\nhave received an education, and a diploma or degree in professional\nnursing, in accordance with the commissioner's regulations (;) and in\norder to continue to maintain registration as a registered\nprofessional nurse in New York state, have attained a baccalaureate\ndegree in nursing within ten years of initial licensure in accordance\nwith the commissioner's regulations. The department, in its\ndiscretion, may issue a conditional registration to a licensee who\nfails to complete the baccalaureate degree but who agrees to meet the\nadditional requirement within a year. The fee for such a conditional\nregistration shall be the same as, and in addition to, the fee for\nthe triennial registration. The duration of such conditional\nregistration shall be for one year and may be extended, with the\npayment of a fee, for no more than one additional year. Any licensee\nwho is notified of the denial of registration for failure to complete\nthe additional educational requirements and who practices as a\nregistered professional nurse without such registration may be\nsubject to disciplinary proceeding pursuant to section sixty-five\nhundred ten of this title.\n\nSection 3. The provisions of this act shall not apply to: (a) any\nstudent entering a generic program preparing registered professional\nnurses after the effective date of this act; (b) any student\ncurrently enrolled in, or having an application pending in, a program\npreparing registered nurses as of the effective date of this act; and\n\n(c) any person already licensed as a registered professional nurse\nor any unlicensed graduate professional nurse who is eligible to take\nthe National Council Licensure Examination as of the effective date\nof this act.\n\nIn an effort to facilitate the implementation of additional education\nfor registered professional nurses, the NYS Associate Degree Nursing\nCouncil and the Council of Deans of Nursing, Senior colleges and\nUniversities of NYS have actively collaborated to standardize\nrequirements between the two levels.\nIn December 2004, the Council of Deans of Nursing, Senior colleges and\nUniversities adopted the position that RN's prepared in NYS,\nassociate degree nursing programs applying to baccalaureate degree\nprograms would be granted 30 nursing credits in addition to liberal\narts and sciences credits that could be applied to the 120 credits\nfor the baccalaureate degree for prior completion of course work at\nthe associate degree level. There are also ever increasing\nopportunities in New York for distance learning and other innovative\nteaching strategies that support the registered professional nurses\nin achieving the additional education required by this bill. Given\nthe enhancements to the compatibility between associate\nand baccalaureate nursing programs and the ever increasing options for\nadvanced placement and distance learning, this bill can be\nimplemented without disadvantaging future new graduates.\n\nBy requiring the baccalaureate degree for continued registration as a\nregistered professional nurse this bill seeks to be responsive to\nmeet the increasingly complex health care needs of the residents of\nNew York State.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2005-2006: S.5056-A - Higher Education\n2007-2008: Higher Education\n2009-2010: S.1074 - Higher Education\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately and the\ncommissioner is authorized to promulgate any rule or regulation\nnecessary to implement the provisions of this act.\n\n",
