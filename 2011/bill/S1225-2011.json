  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1225\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act to amend the transportation law and the public authorities law,\nin relation to capping fares for paratransit transportation\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nTo ensure fares for paratransit transportation arc set no higher than\nfares for transportation of non-disabled adults\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThis bill would establish the following provisions:\n\n- Language added to clause (a) of subparagraph 4 of paragraph a of\nsubdivision 5 of section 15-b of the transportation law to prevent para-\ntransit fares from surpassing base fares for transportation of non-disa-\nbled adults\n- Language added to section 1266 of public authorities law providing\nthis same fare limitation\n- Act taking effect immediately\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nTitle II of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits\ndiscrimination against people with disabilities in the provision of\ntransportation services.  Authorization of transit fares for people with\ndisabilities at a level higher than those for nondisabled citizens is\ndiscriminatory. To prevent this practice, when the MTA began operating\nits paratransit service, Access-A-Ride, the federal government entered\ninto a memorandum or understanding with the MTA including an agreement\nnever to impose a fare for paratransit riders at a rate higher than the\nregular fare charged to non-disabled riders. Despite this, in its 2009-\n10 proposed budget, the MTA proposed to raise the fare for paratransit\nabove the fare for regular users. This legislation clarifies the princi-\nple of non-discrimination.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009:  S.2933 (Duane) Died in Finance; A.6489 (Kellner) Died in\nWays & Means\n2010:  S.2933 (Duane) Passed Senate; A.6489 (Kellner) Died in\nWays & Means\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
