The superintendent of insurance shall establish rates for  poli-\n   10  cies  providing coverage for physicians and surgeons medical malpractice\n   11  for the periods commencing July 1, 1985 and ending June 30, [2011] 2014;\n   12  provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision of law,  the\n   13  superintendent  shall not establish or approve any increase in rates for\n   14  the period commencing July 1, 2009 and ending June 30, 2010. The  super-\n   15  intendent  shall  direct  insurers  to establish segregated accounts for\n   16  premiums, payments, reserves and investment income attributable to  such\n   17  premium  periods  and  shall  require  periodic  reports by the insurers\n   18  regarding claims and expenses attributable to such  periods  to  monitor\n   19  whether  such  accounts  will  be sufficient to meet incurred claims and\n   20  expenses.

The superintendent  shall  not  impose  such  surcharge\n   29  during  the period commencing July 1, 2009 and ending June 30, 2010.  On\n   30  and after July 1, 1989, the surcharge prescribed by this  section  shall\n   31  be  retained  by insurers to the extent that they insured physicians and\n   32  surgeons during the July 1, 1985 through June  30,  [2011]  2014  policy\n   33  periods;  in  the  event  and to the extent physicians and surgeons were\n   34  insured by another insurer during such periods, all or a pro rata  share\n   35  of  the  surcharge,  as the case may be, shall be remitted to such other\n   36  insurer in accordance with rules and regulations to  be  promulgated  by\n   37  the  superintendent.

Notwithstanding any provision\n    8  of the insurance law, rates already established and to be established by\n    9  the superintendent pursuant to this section are deemed adequate if  such\n   10  rates  would be adequate when taken together with the maximum authorized\n   11  annual surcharges to be imposed for a reasonable period of time  whether\n   12  or  not  any  such  annual surcharge has been actually imposed as of the\n   13  establishment of such rates.\n   14    S 19.
