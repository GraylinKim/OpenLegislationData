  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1882\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to sexual abuse of a person under\nthe age of thirteen\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nThis bill would strengthen New York State's criminal laws that relate\nto adults who sexually abuse children.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nSection one of this bill would amend Penal Law &sect;130.65 as amended by\nChapter 1 of the Laws of 2000, by providing that a person is guilty\nof sexual abuse in the first degree when he or she is twenty-one\nyears old or older and subjects another person to sexual contact who\nis less that thirteen years old. Section two of this bill would\nprovide for the effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIn 2001, the New York State Legislature enacted the Sexual Assault\nReform Act (SARA). Among other amendments, SARA amended Rape in the\nFirst Degree, Penal Law &sect;130.35(4) and Criminal Sexual Act (formerly\nSodomy) in the First Degree, Penal Law &sect;130.50(4). Pursuant to SARA,\nit is a class B violent felony when a perpetrator over the age of\neighteen has sexual intercourse or anal or oral contact with a victim\nunder the age of thirteen.\n\nNo similar crime was made at that time or later to the crime of Sexual\nAbuse in the First Degree, Penal Law &sect;130.65 pursuant to which it is\na class D violent felony only when the victim is under the age of\neleven. Consequently, if a child who is eleven or twelve years old is\nsubjected to sexual contact by an individual who is eighteen or\nolder, the defendant would be guilty of only a class A misdemeanor.\n\nThis legislation would add a subdivision four to Sexual Abuse in the\nFirst Degree making it a class D violent felony offense for a-child\nunder thirteen to be subjected to sexual contact by a person who is\ntwenty-one or older. Besides protecting these vulnerable victims,\nthis legislation would bring the Sexual Abuse in the First Degree\nstatute in line with Rape and Criminal Sexual Act in the First\nDegree. As the law stands in New York, a person who puts their hand\ndown .the pants of an eleven or twelve year old is subjected to the\nsame penalty as a' person-who steals a pack of gum from a convenience\nstore; this is unacceptable, and this measure seeks to correct that\nseeming inequity. Connecticut, New Jersey, Rhode Island. and Indiana\nprovide that similar sexual contact with an individual who is eleven\nor twelve years old is a felony.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n2010:  A.1067A - Passed Assembly/S.1989A Died in Senate\n2009:  A.1067  - Referred to the Assembly Codes Committee/S.1989\nHeld in Rules\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThe first of November next succeeding the date on which it shall have\nbecome a law.\n\n",
