SAMPSON -- read twice and ordered printed, and when\n         printed to be committed to the Committee on Local Government\n\n       AN ACT to amend the county law, in relation to  establishing  guidelines\n         of professional conduct for activities by district attorneys\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Legislative findings.   The legislature hereby  finds  that\n    2  district  attorneys  and  other  public  prosecutors, as public officers\n    3  charged with overseeing that justice is done, owe a duty of fair dealing\n    4  to those accused and candor to the courts. This act seeks to ensure that\n    5  New York state's district attorneys and other public prosecutors  comply\n    6  with  these fundamental duties by establishing a minimum code of conduct\n    7  to guide their behavior in the performance of their  official  responsi-\n    8  bilities.\n    9    The  legislature  also  recognizes that the state and its citizens are\n   10  served not only when the guilty are convicted but when  criminal  trials\n   11  are  fair  and  that our system of the administration of justice suffers\n   12  when any accused is treated unfairly. This act seeks to  guarantee  that\n   13  district  attorneys  and other public prosecutors make timely disclosure\n   14  to the defense of all evidence required to be disclosed pursuant to  the\n   15  laws  and the constitution of the state of New York and the constitution\n   16  of the United States.\n   17    The legislature further  finds  that  collaboration  between  district\n   18  attorneys  and  the  press as to information affecting the fairness of a\n   19  criminal proceeding is not only subject to  regulation,  but  is  highly\n   20  censurable and worthy of penalties therefor. This act seeks to achieve a\n   21  fair  balance between a district attorney's or other public prosecutor's\n   22  right of free speech and society's interest in protecting the  integrity\n   23  of  the  criminal proceedings and thereby guaranteeing a fair and impar-\n   24  tial trial. It is the intent of this legislature to insure that informa-\n   25  tion and statements made by district attorneys and other public prosecu-\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD05887-01-1\n\n       S. 1651                             2\n\n    1  tors is not to solicit coverage for their cause by  employing  the  news\n    2  media  solely  with  a  view  toward gaining some benefit or influencing\n    3  public opinions rather than fulfilling the  prosecutor's  obligation  to\n    4  seek  justice. The purpose of this act is to insure, to the extent prac-\n    5  ticable, the fair and orderly judicial administration in the conduct  of\n    6  criminal proceedings.\n    7    S  2. The county law is amended by adding a new section 708 to read as\n    8  follows:\n    9    S 708.
