  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1252\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the workers' compensation law and the insurance law,\nin relation to providing benefits for family care\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill provides for the payment of disability benefits to employees\nwho take family leave, either to bond with a child under the age of\none, or to care for a sick relative.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 of the bill amends the definition of \"disability\" in\nWorkers' compensation Law (WCL) &sect; 201(9) to include family leave.\n\nSection 2 of the bill amends the definition of \"day of disability\" in\nWCL &sect; 201(14) to include days taken for family leave.\n\nSection 3 of the bill adds paragraphs 15 through 24 to WCL &sect; 201 to\nadd definitions for \"family ;Leave,\" \"child,\" \"domestic partner,\"\n\"serious health condition,\" \"parent,\" \"family member,\" \"in loco\nparentis,\" \"grandchild\" \"health care provider,\" and \"family care\ncost.\" \"Family leave\" is defined to mean any leave from work\nnecessary to care for a seriously ill family member, or to bond with\na child during his or her first twelve months. A \"family member\" is\ndefined to mean a child, spouse, domestic partner, parent or\ngrandchild. \"Family care cost,\" the amount that may be passed on to\nemployees for the cost of the family care benefit, is defined to be\nforty-five cents until, July I, 2013, and thereafter an amount set by\nthe Superintendent of Insurance on an annual basis in accordance with\nstrictures set forth in the bill.\n\nSection 4 of the bill amends WCL &sect; 204 to set the commencement date\nfor a period of family leave as the start of the leave period taken\nby the employee.\n\nSection 5 of the bill amends WCL &sect; 205 to make clear which of its\nprovisions apply to disability for sickness and injury, and which to\nfamily leave, and to set distinct periods for receipt of disability\nbenefits: twenty-six weeks for sickness and injury, and twelve weeks\nfor family leave. It also states that no benefits under this article\nmay be taken for the time an employee is absent from work for\ndisciplinary reasons, and that no family care benefit may be taken\nwhen the employee is absent for personal sickness or injury.\n\nSection 6 of the bill adds a new section 205-a to the WCL to make\nclear that receipt of disability benefits for sickness or injury does\nnot affect the time limitations for family leave, and receipt of\ndisability\n\nbenefits for family leave does not affect the time limitations for\nreceipt of benefits for sickness or injury.\n\nSection 7 of the bill amends WCL &sect; 209(3) to raise the amount of\nweekly disability costs that an employer can pass on to an employee\nfrom sixty cents to sixty cents plus the \"family care cost,\" as\ndefined in WCL &sect; 201 (24).\n\nSection 8 of the bill amends WCL &sect; 211 to make clear that the family\ncare benefits provided for in this bill do not affect or alter\nexisting rights under collective bargaining agreements, and that\nemployers may secure benefits for disability arising from injury or\nsickness, and for family care, from different sources or through\ndifferent means.\n\nSection 9 of the bill amends the WCL to create a new section 211-a to\nallow public employees to opt in to the family care benefit through\ntheir representative organizations. The section sets forth specific\ntimes when such organizations may opt in or out, including three\nmonths prior to the effective date of the bill; upon three months\nnotice where the employer does not already participate in the\nstatutory disability program; and at any mutually agreeable time.\nWhen an employee organization opts into the benefit on behalf of its\nmembers, the employer may require the employees to pay the family\ncare cost, unless there is a collectively negotiated agreement\notherwise.\n\nSection 10 of the bill amends WCL &sect; 212 to make clear that when a\npublic employer opts into benefits under this article, it may do so\nas to disability, family leave, or both.\n\nSection 11 of the bill amends WCL &sect; 76 to allow the State Insurance\nFund to provide insurance for family care benefits, either together\nwith or separate from disability insurance.\n\nSection 12 of the bill amends WCL &sect; 217 to set forth the requirements\nfor proof of disability in cases of family leave, and to require that\nwhere an employee receives disability benefits for time spent caring\nfor a sick relative, the relative must subject himself or herself to\na medical examination in certain circumstances.\n\nSection 13 of the bill amends WCL &sect; 221 to make clear in regard to\ncontested claims that certain proofs of disability applicable to\ncases of sickness or injury must be submitted only when relevant.\n\nSection 14 of the bill amends WCL &sect; 229(2) to require employers to\nprovide each employee with notice regarding disability benefits, in a\nform prescribed by the chair of the Workers' Compensation Board,\nwithin thirty days of the section's effective date, and thirty days\nof any new employee's initial day of work.\n\nSection 15 of the bill adds a new section 239-a to the WCL requiring\nthe Department of Insurance to study, and report to the Governor and\nboth houses of Legislature by April I, 2012, on the feasibility and\nimpact of community rating disability insurance. This section also\nprovides for the creation of a fifteen member family care advisory\ncouncil, which will consult with the Superintendent of Insurance\nand issue reports on various issues relating to the family care\nbenefit.\n\nSection 16 of the bill amends Insurance law subsection 1113 (a) to\ninclude family care benefits and disability benefits from sickness or\ninjury within \"accident and health insurance,\" or insurance against\ndeath or personal injury.\n\nSection 17 of the bill provides the effective date.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nSections 200 through 242 of the WCL require employers to provide for\nthe payment of disability benefits of up to $170 per week when an\nemployee is absent from work due to sickness or injury unrelated to\nhis or her work. Disability is defined to include pregnancy, but not\nany form of family leave unrelated to the employee's own sickness or\ninjury.\n\nSTATEMENT IN SUPPORT:\nMany families today experience a fierce struggle as they attempt to\nbalance the need to earn a living with the need to care for their\nchildren and seriously ill family members. Often economic necessity\nforces parents to return to work very shortly after a child is born\nor adopted.\nAlthough the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) guarantees\ntwelve weeks of unpaid leave to covered workers, a national study\nfound that 77% of those who did not take needed leave under FMLA\nrefrained from doing so because they could not afford the unpaid time.\n\nWith the increase in recent decades of women in the workforce, of dual\nearner households, and of households headed by single parents, often\nthe only potential caretaker for a new child or sick family member is\nan individual who is employed outside of the home. Paid family care\nbenefits will allow those individuals to remain in the workforce even\nas they shoulder their family responsibilities. In addition, because\npeople are living longer, workers a.re increasingly finding it\nnecessary to take time off work to care for elderly parents or\nseriously ill loved ones. For many families, medical emergencies lead\nto financial ruin, resulting not only from medical bills but also\nfrom lack of income.\nAllowing caretakers to receive a modest income during a limited time\naway from work would help forestall such financial distress.\n\nWhen parents are unable to take leave after a child's birth, the\nconsequence is not only disruption for the family but potential\ndamage to the child's development, since research on child\n\ndevelopment shows the important role of early bonding with parents.\nThus, paid family care benefits are a cornerstone of an effective\nbirth-to-five education agenda, and policies that allow parents a\nreasonable payment for time off taken after a birth, adoption, or\nfoster care placement affect not only the workers who are able to\ntake leave but also the rest of New York's residents, who have a\nstake in a healthy next generation. This bill seeks to address these\nproblems by creating a paid family care program.\nUnder the provision of the bill, workers can receive a modest cash\nbenefit for twelve weeks while they are on leave to bond with a\nnewborn, newly adopted child, or newly placed foster child; or to\ncare for a seriously ill parent, child, spouse, domestic partner,\ngrandchild or parent-in-law. Domestic partners are included in\nrecognition of their important role in the furtherance of caring,\ncommitted family relationships, and grandchildren are included in\nrecognition of the many families in which grandparents are the\nprimary caretakers of their grandchildren\n\nThe bill structures the paid family leave program within the existing\nTemporary Disability Insurance (TDI) program administered by the\nWorkers' Compensation Board.\n\nThere are a number of benefits to using the existing TDI system.\n\nFirst, an administrative agency and process for administering the\nprogram already exist, and many of its elements are already\nestablished, such as eligibility requirements, waiting periods,\npenalties, and antifraud protections. Beneficiaries of the paid\nfamily leave program, like the current beneficiaries of TDI, will be\nrequired: (a) to be employed with a covered employer for four weeks\nprior to the date of disability;\nand (b) to wait seven days before receiving benefits.\n\nSecond, employers will not need to adjust to a new program, but will\nsimply augment their existing coverage for disability to include\nfamily leave. Like TDI, the bill covers virtually all private\nemployers, and approximately half of local public employers (those\nthat have already opted in to TDI). TDI itself confers no job\nprotection for employees who miss work because of a qualified\ndisability. only employees covered by FMLA or other leave program\nwould have job protection under this bill.\n\nThird, the cost of providing TDI can be shared between employers and\nemployees. At present, employers may deduct a maximum of 60 cents per\nweek from employees, or $31.20 per year. In practice, not all\nemployers take the 60 cent weekly payroll deduction. The bill would\nallow for the lifting of the current 60 cent cap on the employee\ncontribution, and allow employers to pass on to employees an\nadditional amount equal to the average cost of providing coverage for\nfamily care. For the first year, that amount will be set at 45 cents\nper week, an amount estimated to be sufficient to cover the average\nincrease per employee in the cost of TDI insurance resulting from the\n\nfamily care benefit. Thereafter, the amount will be set by the\nSuperintendent of Insurance based on a sound actuarial calculation of\nthe average cost of providing the benefit.\n\nFourth, the TDI system does not require extensive government\nintervention. Most cases are resolved through the employer, employee\nand insurer, without any government involvement. Many other developed\nnations have some form of paid leave, and this proposal is one of\nmany pending nationwide to provide families with greater support\nduring the critical moments of the lives of their newborn children or\ntheir seriously ill family members. In 2002, California created the\nnation's first paid family leave program, and Washington has now\nenacted a similar proposal. with this bill, New York can move to the\nforefront of this effort to support working families by increasing\ntheir ability to spend time on crucial family matters, and providing\nthem with a means of support during that time.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-2010: S.4074 - Referred to Labor\n\nBUDGET IMPLICATIONS:\nThe bill does require coverage for state employees, and all private\nbenefits are funded either by employers (either through\nself-insurance or a policy purchased from a carrier or the State\nInsurance Fund) or by employees. Either the State or public employee\nunions covering state workers may opt into the benefit, which could\nentail cost if the option was exercised, and depending on whether any\nnegotiated limits were placed on the pass through to employees. The\nbill will also require modest additional administrative expenses for\nsuch increased operation of the Workers' Compensation Board as is\nneeded to administer the new benefits.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis bill takes effect immediately, with provisions.\n\n",
