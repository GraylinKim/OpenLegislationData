Legislative  findings.  The  legislature  finds  that the\n    2  current freedom of information law, enacted in 1977,  has  served  as  a\n    3  critical  vehicle under which the public has gained access to records of\n    4  state and local governmental entities.  The  legislature  further  finds\n    5  that  the freedom of information law places the burden on the individual\n    6  to request information from an agency,  but  that  the  use  of  current\n    7  information  technology, combined with a commitment to proactive disclo-\n    8  sure, has the potential to provide information to the public to an  even\n    9  greater degree than does the current law.\n   10    S 2. The New York state committee on open government is hereby author-\n   11  ized  and  directed to: (a) study the feasibility of requiring agencies,\n   12  as defined in subdivision 3 of section 86 of the public officers law, to\n   13  proactively disclose documents that are available under article 6 of the\n   14  public officers law; (b) make specific findings and  legislative  recom-\n   15  mendations  relating  to mandatory proactive disclosure by agencies; (c)\n   16  estimate the costs or savings of proactive disclosure;  and  (d)  report\n   17  its  findings to the governor, the temporary president of the senate and\n   18  the speaker of the assembly no later than January 31, 2013.\n   19    S 3. This act shall take effect immediately.\n\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD00917-01-1\n",
