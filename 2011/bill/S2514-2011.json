  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2514\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the public health law, in relation to requiring hospitals to\nestablish and utilize procedural medical checklists for the provision of\nall intensive care unit\nmedical procedures\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\n\nThis bill will improve patient health and reduce system-wide health\ncare costs by requiring the use of a proven patient safety checklist\nin intensive care unit (ICU) medical procedures.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\n\nBill &sect;1 adds a new subdivision 11 to &sect;2803 of the Public Health Law,\nproviding that the Commissioner of Health shall by role or regulation\nrequire every hospital to establish, utilize and complete a checklist\nfor each ICU medical procedure occurring at such hospital. Such\nchecklists shall be designed and used for the purposes of reducing\ninfections and related illnesses, improving the health and safety of\npatients, and ensuring that the necessary equipment, supplies,\nfacilities and personnel are available for the conduct of the ICU\nprocedure. The rules and regulations shall be promulgated within 180\ndays of the subdivision's effective date.\n\nEFFECTS OF PRESENT LAW WHICH THIS BILL WOULD ALTER:\n\nNew York State currently has no statutory or regulatory provisions\nrequiring the use of patient safety checklists in conducting ICU\nmedical procedures.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nHealth care associated infections (HAIs) are one of the top ten\nleading causes of death in the United States, and they are estimated\nto add hundreds of millions of donors to the costs of healthcare.\nCentral line associated blood stream infections (CLABSIs)\ncan occur as a result of catheterization of patients in intensive\ncare -- they are estimated to account for\n15% of the roughly 1.7 million HAIs in the United States, but as\nmany as 30%of the 99,000 annual infection-related deaths.\n\nMost CLABSIs can be prevented through the use of a straightforward\npatient safety checklist that has been proven to be successful in\nthe field. In a recent Michigan study, use of the checklist resulted\nin a 66% reduction in CLABSIs, reflected in an estimated savings of\n1500 lives and $200 million in the first 18 months.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is calling on\nhospitals to use this basic tool to reduce central line infections in\nICUs by 75% over the next three years. However, many hospitals have\nnot yet adopted the checklist. This bill will ensure that patients\nreceive the same high-quality health care regardless of which\nhospital in New York State provides their treatment.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\nNone.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\n\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nImmediately.\n\n",
