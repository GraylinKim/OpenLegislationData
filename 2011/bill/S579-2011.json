KLEIN  -- read twice and ordered printed, and when\n         printed to be committed to the Committee on Local Government\n\n       AN ACT to enact the \"wireless facility siting act\"; to amend the general\n         municipal law, in relation to the placement, construction and  modifi-\n         cation of wireless services facilities\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Legislative intent.  Municipal control over the  siting  of\n    2  wireless services facilities is an important component of municipal home\n    3  rule.  The legislature recognizes the federal, state and local interests\n    4  of  providing for proper and convenient wireless services to the public.\n    5  As such, the legislature needs to balance  the  interests  of  providing\n    6  quality wireless communication services with local concerns on the inap-\n    7  propriate  siting  of telecommunications towers. This act provides for a\n    8  process of municipal review for  applications  to  site,  construct  and\n    9  modify  wireless services facilities.  Such process must incorporate the\n   10  needs and desires of the local community, with regard to  the  aesthetic\n   11  ramifications  of  such  siting.  It is the intent of the legislature in\n   12  adopting the \"wireless facility siting act\" to implement enabling legis-\n   13  lation which specifically sets forth a  uniform  statewide  process  for\n   14  municipal  review  of  applications  for the placement, construction and\n   15  modification of wireless services facilities in all municipalities  that\n   16  do  not  have  local laws to regulate the placement of such towers. Each\n   17  municipality shall be able to enact approval  processes  that  are  more\n   18  strict than those established by this act.\n   19    S  2.  Short title. This act shall be known as and may be cited as the\n   20  \"wireless facility siting act\".\n   21    S 3. The general municipal law is amended by adding a new article 13-E\n   22  to read as follows:\n   23                                ARTICLE 13-E\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD04827-01-1\n\n       S. 579                              2\n\n    1                        WIRELESS FACILITY SITING ACT\n    2  SECTION 300.
