  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2748\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the parks, recreation and historic preservation law, in\nrelation to requiring the office of parks, recreation and historic\npreservation to acquire all mineral rights to real property acquired by\nsuch office\n\nPURPOSE OF THE BILL:\nThe purpose of the bill is to ensure that OPRHP acquires the minerals\nrights when acquiring property for state park, historic preservation\nand other uses under its jurisdiction. The bill provides for certain\nexceptions for lands of great significance and importance.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThe bill amends Section 3.17, Subdivision 1 of the Parks, Recreation\nand Historic preservation Law, to require that real property\nacquired, received, held or administered by the OPRHP commissioner\ninclude the mineral rights on and under such lands. The bill does\nallow acquisition and acceptance of lands of great significant and\nimportance without the mineral rights. Such acquisitions or\nacceptances would be subject an analytical report prepared by OPRHP,\nthat justifies and provides the rationale for such acquisition\"\nincluding but not limited to a description of the property, the\nsignificance and importance or the land to the state, and the\neconomic benefits and impacts and local impacts of acquiring such\nproperty. ORPHP would be required to hold one or more public\nhearings, including at least one in the impacted area, and to publish\nsuch actions in the Environmental Notice Bulletin at least one month\nprior to the hearing.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIn the past, OPRHP has acquired or accepted lands for state park\npurposes without acquiring the mineral rights on or under such lands.\nThese mineral rights can be utilized, for example, for extraction of\nmaterials such as oil and gas. Such activities can have a significant\nadverse affect on the dedicated use of the lands (e.g. parks,\nhistoric sites, etc.) and are inconsistent with the dedicated purpose\nof the lands. This bill seeks to correct such problems by limiting\nfuture acquisitions to those which include mineral rights on or\nunder the lands. An exception is provided for lands for great\nsignificance and importance, in which case the acquisition/acceptance\nwould be subject to an in-depth analysis and report of potential\nimpacts by OPRHP and public review.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009/2010: Senate Reported and Committed to Finance.\n           Assembly Referred to Environmental Conservation.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\n\nThe bill may have some effect on the cost of acquiring lands for the\nState Parks system, historic sites and other facilities administered\nby OPRHP.\n\nThere would costs associated with the preparation of the report and\nthe public hearings.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act would take effect immediately and apply to real property\nacquired or received on or after such date.\n\n",
