Except as otherwise expressly provided by an act of the legislature\n   39  or by a local law adopted prior to  September  first,  nineteen  hundred\n   40  fifty-three,  all  contracts for public work involving an expenditure of\n   41  more than  thirty-five  thousand  dollars  and  all  purchase  contracts\n   42  involving  an expenditure of more than twenty thousand dollars, shall be\n   43  awarded by the appropriate officer,  board  or  agency  of  a  political\n   44  subdivision  or  of  any district therein including but not limited to a\n   45  soil conservation district, to the lowest responsible bidder  furnishing\n   46  the  required security after advertisement for sealed bids in the manner\n   47  provided by this section. In any case where a responsible bidder's gross\n   48  price is reducible by an allowance for  the  value  of  used  machinery,\n   49  equipment,  apparatus  or  tools to be traded in by a political subdivi-\n   50  sion, the gross price shall be reduced by the amount of such  allowance,\n   51  for  the  purpose of determining the low bid. In cases where two or more\n   52  responsible bidders furnishing the required  security  submit  identical\n   53  bids  as  to price, such officer, board or agency may award the contract\n   54  to any of such bidders. Such officer, board or agency may, in his or her\n   55  or its discretion, reject all bids and readvertise for new bids  in  the\n   56  manner provided by this section. In determining whether a purchase is an\n\n       S. 2137                             3\n\n    1  expenditure  within  the  discretionary threshold amounts established by\n    2  this subdivision, the officer, board or agency of a  political  subdivi-\n    3  sion  or  of any district therein shall consider the reasonably expected\n    4  aggregate  amount  of all purchases of the same commodities, services or\n    5  technology to be made within the twelve-month period commencing  on  the\n    6  date  of  purchase.    Purchases  of commodities, services or technology\n    7  shall not be artificially divided for  the  purpose  of  satisfying  the\n    8  discretionary  buying  thresholds  established  by  this  subdivision. A\n    9  change to or a renewal of a discretionary purchase shall not be  permit-\n   10  ted  if the change or renewal would bring the reasonably expected aggre-\n   11  gate amount of all purchases of the same commodities, services or  tech-\n   12  nology  from the same provider within the twelve-month period commencing\n   13  on the date of the first purchase to an amount greater than the  discre-\n   14  tionary  buying  threshold amount. For purposes of this section, \"sealed\n   15  bids\", as that term applies to purchase contracts,  shall  include  bids\n   16  submitted  in an electronic format including submission of the statement\n   17  of non-collusion required by section one hundred three-d of  this  arti-\n   18  cle,  provided  that the governing board of the political subdivision or\n   19  district, by resolution, has authorized the  receipt  of  bids  in  such\n   20  format.    Submission in electronic format may, for technology contracts\n   21  only, be required as the sole method for the submission  of  bids.  Bids\n   22  submitted in an electronic format shall be transmitted by bidders to the\n   23  receiving  device  designated  by the political subdivision or district.\n   24  Any method used to receive electronic bids  shall  comply  with  article\n   25  three of the state technology law, and any rules and regulations promul-\n   26  gated  and  guidelines  developed thereunder and, at a minimum, must (a)\n   27  document the time and date of receipt of  each  bid  received  electron-\n   28  ically;  (b)  authenticate  the  identity  of the sender; (c) ensure the\n   29  security of the information transmitted; and (d)  ensure  the  confiden-\n   30  tiality  of  the bid until the time and date established for the opening\n   31  of bids. The timely submission of an electronic bid in  compliance  with\n   32  instructions  provided for such submission in the advertisement for bids\n   33  and/or the specifications shall be the  responsibility  solely  of  each\n   34  bidder or prospective bidder. No political subdivision or district ther-\n   35  ein  shall  incur  any  liability from delays of or interruptions in the\n   36  receiving device designated for the submission and receipt of electronic\n   37  bids.   FOR PURPOSES OF  THIS  SECTION,  THE  TERM  \"LOWEST  RESPONSIBLE\n   38  BIDDER\" SHALL MEAN ANY PERSON, FIRM, CORPORATION, SUCCESSOR CORPORATION,\n   39  CONTRACTOR  OR SUBCONTRACTOR WHO (I) SUBMITS THE LOWEST BID FOR A PUBLIC\n   40  WORK CONTRACT AND (II)  IS  NOT  DISQUALIFIED  ON  GROUNDS  PROVIDED  IN\n   41  SECTION TWO HUNDRED ONE-G OF THE LABOR LAW.\n   42    S  3.  Subdivision  1  of section 103 of the general municipal law, as\n   43  amended by section 2 of part FF of chapter 56 of the laws  of  2010,  is\n   44  amended to read as follows:\n   45    1. Except as otherwise expressly provided by an act of the legislature\n   46  or  by  a  local  law adopted prior to September first, nineteen hundred\n   47  fifty-three, all contracts for public work involving an  expenditure  of\n   48  more  than  thirty-five  thousand  dollars  and  all  purchase contracts\n   49  involving an expenditure of more than twenty thousand dollars, shall  be\n   50  awarded  by  the  appropriate  officer,  board  or agency of a political\n   51  subdivision or of any district therein including but not  limited  to  a\n   52  soil  conservation district, to the lowest responsible bidder furnishing\n   53  the required security after advertisement for sealed bids in the  manner\n   54  provided  by  this  section.  In  determining  whether  a purchase is an\n   55  expenditure within the discretionary threshold  amounts  established  by\n   56  this  subdivision,  the officer, board or agency of a political subdivi-\n\n       S. 2137                             4\n\n    1  sion or of any district therein shall consider the  reasonably  expected\n    2  aggregate  amount  of all purchases of the same commodities, services or\n    3  technology to be made within the twelve-month period commencing  on  the\n    4  date of purchase. Purchases of commodities, services or technology shall\n    5  not  be  artificially  divided for the purpose of satisfying the discre-\n    6  tionary buying thresholds established by this subdivision. A  change  to\n    7  or  a  renewal of a discretionary purchase shall not be permitted if the\n    8  change or renewal would bring the reasonably expected  aggregate  amount\n    9  of  all  purchases  of the same commodities, services or technology from\n   10  the same provider within the twelve-month period commencing on the  date\n   11  of the first purchase to an amount greater than the discretionary buying\n   12  threshold  amount.  In any case where a responsible bidder's gross price\n   13  is reducible by an allowance for the value of used machinery, equipment,\n   14  apparatus or tools to be traded in by a political subdivision, the gross\n   15  price shall be reduced by the amount of such allowance, for the  purpose\n   16  of  determining  the  low  bid.  In  cases where two or more responsible\n   17  bidders furnishing the required security submit  identical  bids  as  to\n   18  price,  such  officer,  board or agency may award the contract to any of\n   19  such bidders. Such officer, board or agency may,  in  his,  her  or  its\n   20  discretion,  reject  all bids and readvertise for new bids in the manner\n   21  provided by this section.   FOR  PURPOSES  OF  THIS  SECTION,  THE  TERM\n   22  \"LOWEST  RESPONSIBLE  BIDDER\"  SHALL MEAN ANY PERSON, FIRM, CORPORATION,\n   23  SUCCESSOR CORPORATION, CONTRACTOR OR SUBCONTRACTOR WHO (A)  SUBMITS  THE\n   24  LOWEST  BID  FOR  A  PUBLIC WORK CONTRACT AND (B) IS NOT DISQUALIFIED ON\n   25  GROUNDS PROVIDED IN SECTION TWO HUNDRED ONE-G OF THE LABOR LAW.\n   26    S 4. This act shall  take  effect  on  the  first  of  September  next\n   27  succeeding  the  date on which it shall have become a law; provided that\n   28  the amendments to subdivision 1 of section 103 of the general  municipal\n   29  law  made  by section two of this act shall be subject to the expiration\n   30  and reversion of such subdivision pursuant to section 41 of  part  X  of\n   31  chapter  62  of  the  laws  of 2003, as amended, when upon such date the\n   32  provisions of section three of this act shall take effect.\n",
