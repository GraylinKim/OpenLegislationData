McDONALD,  DeFRANCISCO,  GOLDEN,  JOHNSON, LANZA,\n         LARKIN, LAVALLE, MAZIARZ, NOZZOLIO, PARKER -- read twice  and  ordered\n         printed, and when printed to be committed to the Committee on Finance\n\n       AN  ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to creating the New York\n         autism spectrum disorders treatment, training and research council and\n         providing for the powers and duties of the council\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section  1.  Intent.  The  legislature  hereby finds and declares that\n    2  autism spectrum disorders, hereinafter ASDs, currently  affect  approxi-\n    3  mately  one  in  110 children and are considered to be an \"urgent public\n    4  health concern\" by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n    5    The legislature further finds that New York state  has  not  responded\n    6  sufficiently  to  this  crisis.  In  its 2010 report, the New York state\n    7  Interagency Task Force on Autism,  hereinafter  Task  Force,  identified\n    8  five  primary  needs  of  the  growing  population  of New York citizens\n    9  affected by ASDs: coordination of state services, early  identification,\n   10  lifelong  service  delivery, increased dissemination of information, and\n   11  coordination of research efforts. First, as a collaborative effort of 11\n   12  independent state agencies that each serve individuals impacted by ASDs,\n   13  the Task Force itself exemplifies the need for coordination of research,\n   14  treatment and training responsibilities. Second, while  the  Task  Force\n   15  determined  that  early  identification and intervention were crucial to\n   16  minimizing the symptoms and impact of ASDs, it reported that only  eight\n   17  percent  of pediatricians routinely screen for ASDs and approximately 30\n   18  percent of children with ASDs do  not  receive  the  early  intervention\n   19  services  provided  by  the  New York State Department of Health. Third,\n   20  recognizing that the thousands of children diagnosed with ASDs will soon\n   21  age out of the state's educational system, the Task Force noted a dearth\n   22  of post-secondary training and transitional services. Fourth,  the  Task\n   23  Force  determined  that  individuals and families affected by ASDs would\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD01579-01-1\n\n       S. 2150                             2\n\n    1  benefit from a centralized clearinghouse of  relevant  information,  and\n    2  called  for  the  provision of user-friendly access to such information.\n    3  Finally, the Task Force reported that  collaboratively  determining  the\n    4  direction of future ASD research would best utilize available public and\n    5  private funding.\n    6    The  legislature  therefore  declares  that  there is a need to expand\n    7  treatment, training and research with regard to ASDs  --  including  the\n    8  enhancement of efforts to improve access to, and the efficacy of, needed\n    9  services, support and treatment.\n   10    S  2.  This  act  shall  be  known, and may be cited, as the \"New York\n   11  autism spectrum disorders treatment, training and research act\".\n   12    S 3.

Finally.\nthis bill not only provides for more efficient and effective\nresearch, but also allows the council flexibility to adapt to any\ninformation yielded as a result.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nNew bill.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone, with the exception of any appropriations made in support of this\nmeasure.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
