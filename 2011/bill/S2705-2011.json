  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2705\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the insurance law, in relation to permitting insurers to make\navailable multiple rating plans for private passenger motor vehicle\ninsurance within the same company\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo permit property/casualty insurers to make available\nmultiple rating plans within the same company\nfor personal lines insurance in the voluntary market.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1: Adds Insurance Law Section 2352 to\npermit insurers to make available multiple rating plans within the\nsame company for personal lines insurance in the voluntary market.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nCurrently, insurance companies are prohibited from\nhaving more than one rating plan within the same company.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nWhile insurance companies are prohibited from having\nmore than one rating plan within the same company, in practice, this\nrestriction only affects smaller, regional insurance companies that\ndo business primarily in New York. Larger insurers, like those that\noperate on a national basis that want to offer multiple rating plans\nto their customers, simply establish a separate subsidiary or\naffiliate company that is set up for the primary purpose of offering\nthe new rating plan. Since smaller insurers lack the financial\nresources to set up separate corporations each time they want to\noffer a new rating plan, they are placed at a competitive\ndisadvantage by the prohibition.\n\nTo remain competitive, insurance companies need to be able to\ncontinually develop new rating plans that introduce different rating\nelements that allow them to better segment and price business.\n\nAdding a new section to the insurance law that specifically authorizes\nmultiple rating plans within the same company will level the playing\nfield so that all insurers, not just large companies, can offer more\nthan one rating plan to their customers. Each time a company develops\na new plan, the plan would be provided only to new business\ncustomers, as is the current practice used when larger insurers\nestablish a separate corporation to offer a new plan.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nNew bill.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
