Subdivisions 7-a and 8 of section 225.00 of the penal law,\n    2  subdivision 7-a as added and subdivision 8 as amended by chapter 632  of\n    3  the laws of 1987, are amended to read as follows:\n    4    7-a.  A  \"coin operated gambling device\" means a gambling device which\n    5  operates as a result of the insertion of something of  value.  A  device\n    6  designed,  constructed  or readily adaptable or convertible for such use\n    7  is a coin operated gambling device notwithstanding the fact that it  may\n    8  require  adjustment, manipulation or repair in order to operate as such.\n    9  A MACHINE WHICH AWARDS FREE OR EXTENDED PLAY IS NOT  A  GAMBLING  DEVICE\n   10  MERELY  BECAUSE  SUCH  FREE OR EXTENDED PLAY MAY CONSTITUTE SOMETHING OF\n   11  VALUE PROVIDED THAT THE OUTCOME DEPENDS UPON THE SKILL OF THE PLAYER AND\n   12  NOT IN A MATERIAL DEGREE UPON AN ELEMENT OF CHANCE.\n   13    8. \"Slot machine\" means a gambling device which, as a  result  of  the\n   14  insertion  of  a coin or other object, operates, either completely auto-\n   15  matically or with the aid of some physical act by the  player,  in  such\n   16  manner  that,  depending upon elements of chance, it may eject something\n   17  of value. A device so constructed, or readily adaptable  or  convertible\n   18  to  such  use,  is  no  less a slot machine because it is not in working\n   19  order or because some  mechanical  act  of  manipulation  or  repair  is\n   20  required to accomplish its adaptation, conversion or workability. Nor is\n   21  it  any  less a slot machine because, apart from its use or adaptability\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD08034-01-1\n\n       S. 2476                             2                            A. 2982\n\n    1  as such, it may also sell or deliver something of value on a basis other\n    2  than chance.  A machine which sells items of merchandise  which  are  of\n    3  equivalent value, is not a slot machine merely because such items differ\n    4  from  each  other in composition, size, shape or color. [A machine which\n    5  awards free or extended play is not a slot machine merely  because  such\n    6  free  or  extended  play may constitute something of value provided that\n    7  the outcome depends in a material degree upon the skill  of  the  player\n    8  and not in a material degree upon an element of chance.]\n    9    S 2.
