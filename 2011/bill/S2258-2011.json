  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2258\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the administrative code of the city of New York and the\nemergency tenant protection act of nineteen seventy-four, in relation to\nthe powers of the rent guidelines board\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill requires landlords to make certain\nrecords\navailable upon the request of the rent guidelines board.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 of this bill amends\nsubdivision b of\nsection 26-510 of the administrative code of the city of New York.\nUpon request by the rent guidelines board, landlords regulated by the\nemergency tenant protection act of 1974 shall make available any\nbooks and records regarding income, expenditures, tax benefits,\nfinancing arrangements, utility bills, and any other pertinent\ninformation to determine rent adjustments. This shall only apply to\ncities with a population of one million or more.\n\nSection 2 adds a new subdivision j to section 26-510 of the\nadministrative code of the city of New York. The rent guidelines\nboard shall be authorized to administer oaths, issue subpoenas,\nconduct investigations, and designate officers to hear reports on\nbehalf of the board.\n\nSection 3 amends subdivision c of section 4 of chapter 576 of the laws\nof 1974. Upon request by the rent guidelines board, landlords\nregulated by the administrative code of the city of New York shall\nmake available any books and records regarding income, expenditures,\ntax benefits, financing arrangements, utility bills, and any other\npertinent information to determine rent adjustments. This shall only\napply to cities with a population of one million or more. All\ninformation provided shall be subject to the freedom of information\nlaw.\n\nThe rent guidelines board shall be authorized to administer oaths,\nissue subpoenas, conduct investigations, and designate officers to\nhear reports on behalf of t,he board.\n\nSection 4 enacts this bill immediately.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe RSL and ETPA require that rent\nguidelines for\nstabilized apartments be promulgated annually based on the economic\ncondition of the residential real estate industry. In practice,\n\nhowever, this mandate has been carried out by rent guidelines boards\nin ways which do not accurately assess the necessity for rent\nadjustments. The New York City rent guidelines board has based rent\nadjustments on an annual survey of vendor costs (fuel, labor, parts,\ninsurance, etc.)\nwith no analysis either of what landlords actually spend for these\nitems or how much rental income they earn. The suburban boards have\nbased rent adjustments on an unverified annual survey of costs and\nincome.\n\nFor the first time, this legislation requires that rent adjustments\nare based on actual increases in landlords' costs of maintaining\ntheir properties. Landlords should base need for rental increases on\nincreased costs of maintenance and costs of improvements. Rental\nincreases can thereby be justified after a review of the records\nindicating these increased costs of business.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nNew bill.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately following the\nexpiration of certain provisions of the rent stabilization and\nemergency tenant protection act.\n\n",
