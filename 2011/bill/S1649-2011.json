  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1649\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the private housing finance law, in relation to establishing\nthe\nurban homeowners assistance program; and making an appropriation therefor\n\nPURPOSE:\nAuthorizes contracts for the release of grant moneys to neighborhood\npreservation companies to provide home ownership assistance activities.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThe private housing finance law is amended by adding a new article\n16-B to define the urban home ownership assistance program.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThere is currently a mortgage crisis in the United States and the\nState of New York. Rising interest rates are dramatically increasing\nthe amounts of required monthly mortgage payments for home owners who\nfinanced their property by using Adjustable Rate Mortgages. In some\ncases consumers are required to pay double what their former payments\nwere under their old rates. In addition, \"Interest Only\" payment\nplans, \"No Money Down\" and 40-year mortgage loans are also leading\nconsumers to greater hardship and financial difficulty. Inability to\npay mortgages leads more consumers to bankruptcy or foreclosure.\n\nHome owners in danger of foreclosure are in need of technical and legal\nassistance. New home owners are in need of financial literacy to\nadvise them on the perils and pitfalls of the various mortgages\navailable in the market. Providing funds to enable these homeowners\nto consul with professionals, such as the neighborhood preservation\ncompanies, can save New York consumers time, money, frustration and\nlegal peril.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nNone.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.5936 of 2007 05/24/07 Referred to Finance\nS.126 of 2009\n01/07/09 REFERRED TO FINANCE\n03/18/09 COMMITTEE DISCHARGED AND COMMITTED TO\nHOUSING, CONSTRUCTION AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT\n01/06/10 REFERRED TO HOUSING, CONSTRUCTION AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nUnknown at present time.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
