  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2425\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the public lands law, in relation to site selection for state\nuse\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\n\nThe purpose of this legislation is to reduce the prevalence of urban\nand suburban sprawl and to help improve the social, economic,\nenvironmental, and cultural conditions of communities in urban areas\nby requiring that site selection for new state government buildings\nconsider a variety of factors relating to best possible use of\nexisting facilities and infrastructure.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\n\nA new section 2-c is added to the public lands law that:\n\n* Declares it to be the intention of the State of New York to make its\nfacilities and use of space serve to strengthen the State's cities\nand make them more attractive places to live and work;\n\n* Requires that consideration of space and facility needs of the State\nshall first focus on urban centralized community business areas;\n\n* Establishes criteria and alternatives upon which the siting of State\nfacilities shall be based, including availability of existing state\ncontrolled facilities, acquisition or utilization of existing\nprivately owned facilities, opportunities for locating cultural,\neducation, recreational, or commercial activities within the proposed\nfacility, and analysis of compatibility of the site with state,\nregional, or local development and conservation objectives; and,\n\n* Requires the Commissioner of the Office of General Services to\ndevelop programs helping to promote the efficient acquisition and\nutilization of state-owned space.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that urban and suburban sprawl, or the\ninefficient, unplanned development of resources away from existing\nurban centers is a serious problem in the State of New York. One\nfactor that heavily contributes to sprawl is the relocation of\ngovernment office buildings and facilities away from urban centers\nwhile existing infrastructure and resources within these centers go\nunder utilized.\n\nThis legislation attempts to address this problem by requiring that\nthe State work with local governments to consider acquiring or\nutilizing facilities and infrastructure that already exists within\ncities in New York. By considering the recreational, cultural,\nenvironmental, economic, and commercial needs of urban areas when\nchoosing new sites for state facilities, the livability of our cities\nwill increase and the precious open space resources outside of them\nwill be better conserved.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n2009-10: S.5683 Died in Finance\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nSignificant cost savings could be realized by both the State and local\ngovernments due to the maximization of the use of existing resources\nin our urban areas and the conservation of undeveloped areas on their\noutskirts.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
