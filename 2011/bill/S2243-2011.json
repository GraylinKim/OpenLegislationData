  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2243\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the legislative law, in relation to cost/benefit analysis\nfor mandated health insurance benefit bills\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThis bill would amend the\nlegislative law by adding a new section 54-b\nto require a cost/benefit analysis of\nany mandated health benefit bill which is to be considered by the\nlegislature. A mandated health insurance benefit bill is defined as:\na bill which mandates health insurance coverage or the offering of\nsuch coverage for specific health services, health care providers or\ndiseases as part of an individual or group accident/health insurance\npolicy or Article 43 contract. The bill requires that any such bill\nwhich is to be considered for passage by the legislature be\naccompanied by a separate, independent statement on the cost of the\nbill as well as the relative need which has been demonstrated for the\nbill.\n\nThe cost/benefit analysis is to be conducted by the Insurance\nDepartment and will include, but not be limited to, the following\ninformation:\n\nThe extent to which - the medical care addressed in the bill is\navailable to and utilized by the general population;\n\n-insurance coverage for such medical care is currently available;\n\n-lack of coverage may result in an individual not receiving necessary\nmedical care or incurring financial hardship upon receiving such care;\n\n-the bill's implementation may have an impact on the future cost or\nutilization of such medical care; Â·\n\n-such coverage might serve as an alternative to more expensive medical\ncare;\n\n-the coverage might affect the future number and types of providers of\nsuch medical care;\n\n-such coverage might impact the cost of insurance premiums or\nadministrative expenses to insureds, insurers and employers.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThere are currently a large number of\nbills pending for\nconsideration in the legislature which, if enacted, would further\nexpand the amount of health insurance coverages mandated by law.\n\nThere are bills to require inpatient treatment of alcoholism,\ntreatment for the mentally disabled, well-baby treatment, infertility\ntreatment, PAP smears, procreative services for veterans, bone marrow\ntransplant procedures, treatment for victims of Alzheimer's Disease\nand treatment by home dialysis technicians, speech language\npathologists and psychiatric\nmental health nurses. Many of these bills may be worthy of enactment\nwhen considering the long-range cost savings to employers or the\nsocial need for such coverage.\n\nHowever, some of these bills may not be so feasible and may further\nadd to the cost of providing or affording health care insurance. It\nis necessary for lawmakers to have access to in-depth analyses of\nthese proposals in order that they may make responsible decisions as\nto their merit. Given the current crisis in the affordability and\navailability of\nhealth insurance, the necessity for each one of these bills must be\nweighed carefully.\n\nThis bill would require an independent cost/benefit analysis of the\nproposal before one of these bills can be enacted into law. The\nanalysis, which would be done by the State Insurance Department,\nwould provide legislators with comprehensive information on the need\nfor such coverage by the general population, as well as the cost to\ninsureds and employers alike. Bills similar to this one have been\nimplemented in at least eighteen different states and have worked to\nprevent the enactment of frivolous mandated benefits legislation.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to the state. Even if\nadditional funding is\nnecessary for the Insurance Department to implement this bill, the\noperating expenses of the Department are currently paid by the\nassessments collected against domestic insurance carriers and by\ninsurance examination fees.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the\n120th day after it\nshall have become a law, provided that the Insurance Department has\npromulgated all the rules and regulations necessary for the\nimplementation of this act.\n\n",
