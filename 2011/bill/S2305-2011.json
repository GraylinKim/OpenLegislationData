  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2305\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act to amend the mental hygiene law, in relation to limiting the site\nselection for community residences for the disabled\n\nSUMMARY:\nThis bill amends section 41.34 of the mental hygiene law, as amended by\nchapter 1024 of the laws of 1981 so that if a sponsoring agency intends\nto establish a residential facility for the disabled within a munici-\npality and does not have a specific site for this facility, they may\nnotify the chief executive officer of the municipality in writing. The\nsponsoring agency must provide the nature, size and community support\nrequirements of the program.\n\nHowever, as an additional provision, this bill holds that no new resi-\ndential facility shall be sited or established within a one mile radius\nof an existing facility.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nWe are approaching a situation in which oversaturation by residential\nfacilities for the disabled in certain areas is becoming an issue. In\nthe past, the coordination of the development and construction of these\nresidential facilities has been done irresponsibly and inefficiently. It\nis the hope that by restricting the proximity within which an organiza-\ntion can establish a residential facility for the disabled, we will\navoid the dilemma which oversaturation has often created.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATION:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to site\nselections made on and after the effective date of this act.\n\n",
