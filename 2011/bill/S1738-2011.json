  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1738\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the criminal procedure law, in relation to eliminating the\nstatute of limitations for class B violent felonies\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill is designed to enhance public safety and protect victims of\nviolent crime by removing the current five year statute of\nlimitations with respect to the prosecution of B violent felony\noffenses, thereby enabling prosecutors to commence such criminal\nactions at any time.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nAmends 30.10(2) of the criminal procedure law by providing that a B\nviolent felony criminal action may be commenced at any time.\n\nAmends 30.10(3) of the criminal procedure law to make certain\nconforming and technical changes.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nStatutes of limitations in criminal cases require the legislature to\nbalance protecting a defendant's interests in defending themselves\nand protecting citizens. By setting a maximum time within which a\nprosecution must be commenced, statutes of limitation, however, are\nnot constitutionally derived; rather they reflect \"legislative\nagreements of relative interests of the State and the defendant in\nadministering and receiving justice.\"\n\nIn balancing between the conflicting policies of preserving an\nindividual's right to defend himself or herself after the passage of\ntime, the legislature determined that certain crimes are so serious,\nso damaging to the fabric of ordered society that no statute of\nlimitations should apply. As such the legislature exempted from the\nstatute of limitations all class A felony offenses, which include\ncrimes such as murder in the first and second degrees, arson and\nkidnapping in the first degrees, and the highest level of drug\noffenses.\n\nBy exempting class A felonies from the statute of limitations, current\nlaw adequately recognizes that offenders who commit class A felonies\noften cause lasting harm, not only to victims and their families, but\nalso to our system of justice. Other law must be strengthened to\nprovide clear recognition of the gravity of violent, serious crimes\nand the compelling importance of prosecuting serious offenders, by\nextending the statute of limitations. The bill accomplishes that end\nby removing the statute of limitations for class B violent felony\noffenses.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\nS.5321 - Passed Senate in 2004\nS.2214 of 2005-06 - Passed Senate both years\nS.454 of 2008-09 - Passed Senate both years\nS.1567 of 2009-10 - Referred to Codes\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to offenses\ncommitted on and after such date as well as to offenses committed\nprior thereto, provided that this act shall not apply to offenses\ncommitted prior to such date on which the prosecution thereof was\nbarred under the provisions of section 30.10 of the criminal\nprocedure law in effect immediately prior to such date.\n\n",
