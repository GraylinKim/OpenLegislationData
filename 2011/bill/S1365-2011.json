  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1365\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to removing a certain time period\nfor the crime of persistent sexual abuse\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nThe purpose of this\nbill is to remove\nthe ten year time period in relation to being defined as a person who\nhas committed persistent sexual abuse. Previously, one who had\ncommitted the crime of forcible touching, sexual abuse in the third\ndegree, or sexual abuse in the second degree, within a ten year\nperiod, would be guilty of persistent sexual abuse.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nSection 1. Amends section 130.53 of the penal law\n\nSection 2. Establishes the effective date\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nSexual abuse is a serious issue.\nPreventative measures\nmust be taken in order to protect the people of the great State of\nNew York. Those who commit sexual abuses must know that such acts\nwill not be tolerated, and the consequences for such acts should\nreflect that message accordingly. By allowing individuals to be\nconvicted of a class E felony only if one commits the sexual abuses\nwithin a ten year period sends the wrong message and must be\ncorrected. This legislation aims to correct this oversight.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-10:  S.7434 - Referred to Codes; Passed Senate 58-1\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the first of November\nnext succeeding the date on which the act shall have become a law.\n\n",
