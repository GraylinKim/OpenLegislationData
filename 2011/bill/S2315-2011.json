  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2315\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act to amend the public authorities law, in relation to public notice\nof certain hazardous conditions by the New York city transit authority\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nThis bill would require the New York City Transit Authority to post\nwarnings in stations whose noise levels are in violation of the Rapid\nTransit Noise Code Act of 1982.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThe Rapid Transit Noise Code Act of 1982 requires the New York City\nTransit Authority to measure and record the noise levels of each of\ntheir stations. This bill would direct the New York City Transit Author-\nity to review these measurements and in each case where the noise levels\nequal or exceed 90 db, the New York City Transit Authority must post\nnotices which include: a) the risk of hearing loss assumed by the\npassengers, b) a recommendation for passengers to wear hearing protec-\ntors; c) a NYCTA telephone number for passengers to call for further\ninformation, etc.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe Rapid Transit Noise Code Act of 1982 has mandated the NYCTA to\nreduce the noise emitted by their rapid transit systems.  Currently, the\nnoise abatement measures taken by the NYCTA do not meet the required\nschedule for compliance with the Rapid Transit Noise Code Act. As a\nresult, noise levels remain well in excess of 90 db, a level which\nmedical studies have shown will result in the loss of hearing.  This\nbill will notify transit riders of the potential health risks, warn them\nto take necessary precautions against hearing loss and provide a NYCTA\ntelephone number to call for further information.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nMinimal.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the sixtieth day after it shall have\nbecome a law.\n\n",
