  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1301\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to\nprohibiting commercial vehicles from stopping and standing\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill is designed to discourage commercial vehicles in the City of\nNew York from illegally stopping and standing by adding points to a\ncommercial driver's license for each violation.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection One of the bill amends the administrative code of the City of\nNew York by prohibiting any person from stopping or standing a\ncommercial vehicle in the City of New York except when necessary to\navoid conflict with other traffic or in compliance with a police\nofficer or a traffic control signal.\n\n\"Commercial Vehicle\" is defined in this section to mean a motor\nvehicle designed, maintained, or used primarily for the\ntransportation of property, or a motor vehicle having a Seating\ncapacity of fifteen or more passengers in addition to the driver and\nused for the transportation of persons. While stopping and standing\nis Prohibited by this title and local laws, a commercial vehicle may\nstop temporarily for loading and unloading merchandise or passengers.\nIt will be an affirmative defense by the person who received the\nsummons that he or she was actively engaged in business at the time\nthe summons was issued at a premises located within three city blocks\nof where the summons was issued.\n\nThe Section does not apply to Vehicles owned and operated by gas or\noil heat suppliers or gas or oil heat systems maintenance companies,\nor any public utilities. This section shall not apply to State or\nlocal municipal vehicles.\n\nA violation of this section shall be punishable in accordance with the\npoint system pursuant to part one hundred thirty-one of subchapter J\nof chapter one of title fifteen of the NYCRR. A commercial vehicle\nmay also be subject to impoundment or other fees and sanctions in\naddition to the points added per violation.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nCurrently, there are no points added to a commercial driver's license\nfor these violations.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nBy ever increasing numbers, illegal commercial traffic in the City of\nNew York has clogged neighborhood streets. These vehicles double-park,\nidle, and pick up and drop off passengers in spite of traffic laws\nprohibiting them from doing so in residential neighborhoods. As a\n\nresult, these tour buses, trucks, jitneys, vans, black cars,\nlimousines, charter buses, and other commercial vehicles have turned\nNew York City neighborhoods into a de facto parking lot.\n\nThis problem is more than just mere inconvenience for residents. 8t.\nClare's Hospital in the Clinton/Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan\nhas recently stated that such parking problems could affect the\nability of emergency vehicles to reach necessary destinations and\nreturn to the hospital in optimal time.\n\nThis bill in no way stops commercial vehicles from going about their\nlegitimate business. The legislation allows for the normal unloading\nand loading of property and passengers, or in the case of an\nemergency. City and State municipal vehicles, as well as public\nutilities, are exempt from this legislation.\n\nAdding points to a commercial driver's license for each violation will\nsend a strong message to those drivers who blatantly disregard the\nCity of New York's stopping and standing regulations that needlessly\ncongest residential streets will not be tolerated.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:;\n1999-2000: S.6152 died in Senate Cities Committee\n2001-2002: S.2036 died in Senate Cities Committee\n2003-2004: S.2080 died in Senate Cities Committee\n2005-2006: S.1068 died in Senate Cities Committee\n2007:      S.1765 (Duane), Died in Senate Cities\n2008:      S.1765 (Duane), Died in Senate Cities\n2009:      S.1349 (Duane), Died in Senate Cities\n2010:      S.1349 (Duane), Died in Senate Cities\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nMinimal.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
