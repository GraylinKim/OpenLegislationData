SALAND, FLANAGAN, HANNON, LITTLE, MARTINS -- read\n         twice and ordered printed, and when printed to  be  committed  to  the\n         Committee on Finance\n\n       AN  ACT  to  amend  the  general municipal law and the education law, in\n         relation to requiring the state to fund certain programs mandated  for\n         municipal  corporations  and school districts; and to amend the educa-\n         tion law, in relation to the effect of mandates on school districts\n\n         THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section  1.  Legislative intent. State mandated programs, unlike local\n    2  service decisions, place local taxpayers  and  local  officials  in  the\n    3  position  of paying for services that they do not control. Increasingly,\n    4  however, the state has set local priorities and forced municipal  taxing\n    5  decisions  by  mandating services, programs, and standards. As a result,\n    6  many local governments and school districts  are  today  in  an  acutely\n    7  difficult fiscal situation.\n    8    Thus,  in  order  to prevent irresponsible state actions which prevent\n    9  localities from making their own decisions,  and  which  force  unwanted\n   10  local  property  tax  increases,  it  is  necessary to ensure that state\n   11  mandates will not be forced on localities and  school  districts  unless\n   12  they are adequately funded.\n   13    S  2.  The general municipal law is amended by adding a new section 25\n   14  to read as follows:\n   15    S 25. FUNDING OF MANDATES. 1. DEFINITIONS.
