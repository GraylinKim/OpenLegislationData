  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2489\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to criminal interference with\nfuneral services\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo afford the same legal protections from disruption and\nharassment to funeral services that are now offered under New York\nState Penal law to reproductive services clinics and religious\nassemblies.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 amends Section 240.70 of the Penal Law to afford the same\nprotections to funerals as are now given to reproductive services\nclinics and religious assemblies. Funeral services for purposes of\nthis section would include any funeral, funeral procession, wake,\nmemorial service, burial or burial plot. Prohibits disruptive\nbehavior within 300 feet of a funeral service and classifies a first\nconviction of such as a class A misdemeanor.\n\nSection 2 establishes that a second or subsequent offense under this\nsection shall be a class E felony.\n\nSection 3 establishes an immediate effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nSection 240.70 of the Penal Law protects a religious\nassembly from attempts to injure, intimidate or interfere with\nanother person because such person was or is seeking to exercise the\nright of religious freedom at a place of religious worship. There\nhave been repeated instances within the past few years of extremist\nhate groups using the funerals of slain United States service members\nas an opportunity to harass the surviving family members and express\ntheir views that these fallen troops somehow \"deserved\" their fate\nbecause of the military policies of the United States.\n\nAs long as the First Amendment remains in force, the right of\nAmericans to express even the most loathsome ideas is fully\nprotected. In the case of these recent military funeral protests\nhowever, it is arguable that the primary goal of the \"protesters\" is\nto cause as much psychological damage as possible upon the grief\nstricken survivors - hence the choice of the funeral or burial as a\nvenue for \"protest.\" This bill does not argue that any point of view\nbe proscribed in New York;\nrather the purpose is to provide a measure of protection and\ntranquility to the mourners.\n\nIn addition, religious traditions consider a funeral and/or burial to\nbe one of its most spiritually important and somber events or\n\nsacraments. Given that this section already applies in general to\nreligious assemblies, it is more than appropriate that what is for\nmany faiths one of the most important forms of religious assembly be\nspecifically protected from hate fueled disruption.\nEven for citizens of no religious belief at all, the funeral or burial\nof a loved one will be an event of profound sadness and loss. All New\nYorkers are due a measure of peace at such a time.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nNew bill in Senate.\nA.2772  (2009-10), Held in Codes\nA.2779  (2007-08), Held in Codes\nA.10840 (2005-06), Held in Codes\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately upon enactment.\n\n",
