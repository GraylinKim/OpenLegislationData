  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1805\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the education law, in relation to the development of\na comprehensive campus security plan\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nTo allow security officers more enforcement authority, to expand on\nexisting campus security laws and regulations.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\n1) A new section 6435-a is created to require each campus to use its\nexisting advisory committees on campus security to establish a\ncomprehensive security plan. It also requires each campus to\nestablish a relationship with its local police force.\n\n2) The plan must address how the campus will respond to various types\nof emergencies. It must include law enforcement, emergency medical\npersonnel, the use of various communications monitoring and sensor\ntechnology and the mapping of campus grounds and facilities.\n\n3) The plan also requires that each campus conduct emergency/drills,\nto evaluate such drills against standards that have been developed in\nconsultation with local law enforcement and that have been reviewed\nby the New York State Police.\n\n4) The bill requires SUNY & CUNY to implement several pilot programs\nin order to test various technologies related to the identification\nof security threats and; how to respond to those threats.\n\n5) The legislation also requires each campus to establish a protocol\nfor the reporting of instances when there is a concern regarding the\nmental health of a student and it also requires that such\ncampus increase the number of mental health counselors and provide\nfunding for SUNY & CUNY to increase those numbers.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nThis bill is an effort to address campus security issues for two\nperspectives. The first is the importance of securing the safety of\nall students and personnel on a college campus. The second is to\nensure that each campus develop a process to handle mental health\nissues in a manner consistent with the interests of the individual\nand his or her privacy and the safety of all college personnel and\nstudents. As we learned from the tragic events of Virginia Tech, the\nsecurity and safety of students and college personnel can be related\nto the mental health of those on campus.\n\nIn order to address these issues this legislation requires that every\ncollege develop a comprehensive security plan that includes\nintegration of local law enforcement and emergency medical personnel\nin response to emergency situations. It also requires that these\n\n\ncampuses conduct emergency drills and allow SUNY & CUNY to develop\npilot or demonstration projects to test various technologies that\ncould improve our ability to monitor, identify and respond to\nsecurity related threats.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n2009-10:  S.876\n2007-08:  S.6264-A\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis act shall take effect on the thirtieth day after it shall have\nbecome a law.\n\n",
