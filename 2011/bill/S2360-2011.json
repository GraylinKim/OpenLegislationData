  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2360\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to confidentiality of information\ncontained in an application for a pistol license\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo enhance the personal privacy rights of pistol licensees.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThe bill prohibits the public disclosure\nof information in an application for a pistol license with\nexceptions for prosecutors and police conducting an active\ninvestigation.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nSomeone who applies for a license to carry or possess a\nhandgun pursuant to the Penal Law completes an application and\nundergoes a rigorous and thorough background investigation that will\ninclude collection of fingerprints, references, and other personal\ninformation. An applicant's file, once the license is granted by the\nlicensing officer, may contain material and notes compiled by police\nagencies performing a background check. The file may be updated\nperiodically to include the kinds and numbers of firearms registered\nto the applicant.\n\nThe recent publication of the names and addresses of pistol licensees\nin a three county area demonstrates the need to preserve the privacy\nof licensees. Dissemination of the names and addresses of\npistol licensees identifies -- right down to street addresses --\nlikely gun owners from whom criminals can steal guns. Guns stolen\nfrom lawful owners can find their way onto the streets and may be\nused in the commission of crimes. Preventing the theft of guns and\ntheir criminal misuse is an important public policy goal and the bill\nwill protect lawful gun owners from being targeted by thieves for gun\nburglaries and remove an important source of information for criminals.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.7911 of 2010; S.2733/A.10151 of 2007-08.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
