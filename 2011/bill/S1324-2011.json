  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1324\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the social services law, in relation to assignment of\nsocial services recipients to local offices\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\n\nThe purpose of this bill is to improve an individual's accessibility\nto a local social services office.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\n\nThe social services law is amended by adding a new section 134-c. This\nbill would provide that an individual applying for or receiving\npublic assistance or care may choose the local social services office\nmost geographically accessible to that person's residence, provided\nthat the office in question has the capacity to handle the case. An\napplicant or recipient would receive written notice of this provision.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nMany social services applicants and recipients have to travel to\noffices which are far from their place of residence. This bill would\nrequire the assignment of these people to the local office which is\nthe most accessible to their residence. By requiring this, social\nservices applicants and recipients will not have to travel to a\nrandomly assigned social services office and incur unnecessary\nexpenses. In addition, the social services office will be accessible\nto the community it serves and more aware of the needs of its clients.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n1991/1992: A.5272\n1995/1996: A.2300\n1997/1998: A.1631\n1999/2000: A.2496\n2001/2002: A.1345\n2003/2004: A.2183\n2004/2005: A.3368\n2005/2006: A.3688A\n2007/2008: A.950-A\n2007/2008: S.494A\n2009/2010: S.1650A/A.2417 - Advanced to Third Reading/Passed Assembly\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis  act  shall  take  effect  immediately  provided, however, that the\ncommissioner of the Office of Temporary and  Disability  Services  shall\npromulgate  such rules and regulations as are necessary to implement the\nprovisions of this act on or before January 1, 2013.\n\n",
