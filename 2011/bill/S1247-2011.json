  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1247\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the labor law, in relation to sex offender\nregistry check for certain employers\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nTo prevent employers from hiring sex offenders and child abusers for\npositions in which they would have substantial contact with children\nand to prevent those on the New York state Sex Offender Registry and\nthe Statewide Central Registry of Child Abuse and Maltreatment from\nholding jobs in which they would have substantial contact with\nchildren.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nA new section, 201-g, is amended into the Labor law.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nKeeping children safe from dangerous predators must be our first\npriority. Public school hiring policy already acknowledges how\nimportant background checks are for those we trust, especially around\nour children.\nExtending the background check requirement to other fields which are,\nby their nature, child oriented serves the community as a whole. It\nwould give parents the assurance that their child is safer. It would\nreduce the risk of creating new victims of sexual abuse by barring\nknown offenders from interacting with children. It would also deter\noffenders from seeking employment in fields which would give them the\nmeans to re-offend.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010: S.6998 - Passed the Senate 61-0.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to the State.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
