  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2671\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public health law, the county law and the civil practice\nlaw and rules, in relation to review and investigation of claims of\nprofessional medical misconduct or medical malpractice and requirements\nfor the filing of such claims\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nAmends the public health law by adding a new subdivision 12-a which\nwill require the Commissioner of Health to develop a program whereby\na certain number of malpractice claims brought against a physician\nwill trigger a mandatory review by the Board of Professional Medical\nConduct.\nThe Board shall make a determination as to whether further\ninvestigation and hearings are necessary. In establishing the\nprogram, the Commissioner shall take into account the specifics of a\nparticular physician's practice, including his specialty and the size\nand scope of his practice.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIn light of the current medical malpractice crisis it is imperative\nthe State take a more active role in removing incompetent or\nnegligent physicians. A recent news story reported a physician with\nover 30 claims against him. By instituting a procedure which would\ntrigger a mandatory review by the Board of Professional Medical\nConduct after a specified number of claims, this bill will help\nassure that the potentially dangerous physician will not slip through\nthe system.\n\nThe bill acknowledges that due to the specialty and the size of one's\npractice, the likelihood for being subject to a malpractice suit\nvaries greatly. By the nature of their practice, obstetrics and\nneurosurgeons are subject to higher risk and allegations of\nmalpractice. Consequently, two or three suits filed against a\nneurosurgeon may be within the realm of acceptability, while the same\nnumber of suits against a dermatologist may indicate a problem.\nTherefore the bill requires the Commissioner to take these factors\ninto account when establishing numerical thresholds.\n\nSince the Board of Professional Medical Conduct currently receives\ninformation on every malpractice case that is filed, a centralized\ndata bank processing this information could be created and used for\nthe purposes of this bill.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n180 days after it becomes law.\n\n",
