  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1797\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act to amend the tax law, in relation to the tax credits for the\nrehabilitation of historic properties\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\n\nTo exempt the tax credit for rehabilitation of historic properties from\nthe temporary deferral of tax credits found in the 2010-2011 Revenue\nBill, S.6610C/A.9710D.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\n\nSection 1 removes the tax credit for rehabilitation of historic proper-\nties from the list of tax credits subject to deferral pursuant to part Y\nof S.6610C/A.9710D.\n\nSection 2 sets forth the effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nThis bill ensures that the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit (HRTC),\nspecifically the credit for the rehabilitation of historic properties,\nremains a vital tool for economic development in New York state by\nexempting it from the current proposal to defer certain tax credits. The\ncurrent deferral plan found in Part Y of the 2010-2011 Revenue bill\nwould defer historic rehabilitation tax credits above $2 million in\nvalue until 2013. While this $2 million cap presumably eliminates a\nnumber of credits from the impact.  of the deferral plan, as applied to\nthe HRTC, the deferral will impede financing for the largest, most cata-\nlytic projects capable of spurning economic development. Such projects\ngenerate the largest and most sustained construction employment and\npost-construction jobs and have the most trans formative value, both\neconomically and in terms of community renewal.\n\nThe current HRTC program was created in such a way to promote economic\ngrowth and development even in the midst of difficult economic times.\nThus, the current deferment proposal would significantly . weaken the\nprogram as an economic development tool. By carving out the HRTC from\nthe tax credit deferment package, we protect the vitality of a program\nthat catalyzes economic activity and promotes environmental sustainabil-\nity within communities across the state of New York.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n08/11/10 - Referred to Ways and Means\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nImmediately.\n\n",
