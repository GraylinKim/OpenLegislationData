  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2291\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act to amend the alcoholic beverage control law, in relation to\nlicenses to sell liquor for off-premises consumption near schools\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo extend the zone around a school or place of worship, in which no\npremises may be granted a retail license to sell liquor and/or wine for\noff-premises consumption, to 350 feet on the same street.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThe bill prohibits the granting of retail licenses to sell liquor and/or\nwine for off-premises consumption to any premises located on the same\nstreet and within 350 feet of a building occupied exclusively as a\nschool or place of worship. No license shall be denied to any premises\nwhere such a license has been in existence continuously since before the\nschool or place of worship was occupied exclusively as such.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nThe bill amends subdivision 3 of section 105 of the alcoholic beverage\ncontrol law, to extend the restricted zone from 200 feet to 350 feet.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe dangers of locating an establishment which sells liquor within\nshouting distance of a school or place of worship are clear. It creates\nan unsavory juxtaposition and sends a troubling message to young people\nin our society, who should be finding edification in their schools and\nplaces of worship.\n\nThe law already recognizes this, and this bill merely extends the\nrestricted zone to a more reasonable distance of 350 feet.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to those licenses\nissued after such date.\n\n",
