  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1291\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the New York city civil court act, in relation to requiring\nthe housing court to provide certain information to tenants\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nThis bill requires tenants in housing court to be given certain\ninformation when receiving or submitting certain information to\ntenants.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThis bill would amend section 110 of the New York city Civil Court Act\nby adding a new subdivision Q.\n\nEFFECTS OF PRESENT LAW THIS BILL WOULD ALTER:\nStates that included with any and all documents submitted to a tenant\nin non-payment or eviction proceeding that there shall be a statement\ninforming the tenant of the following:\n\n1) That housing court clerks cannot determine the validity of cases\nand that they have a right to a trial;\n\n2) That tenants can offset poor services or lack of repairs against\nthe rent;\n\n3) That tenants may call for an inspection while filing the proper\npaperwork and can wait for the inspection to be ordered by a housing\njudge;\n\n4) That tenants may at any time go to a pro se clerk for advice;\n\n5) That only a housing court judge may force or ask a tenant to leave\nhis or her apartment;\n\n6) The office of court administration sells information to residential\nscreening companies;\n\n7) Legal fees, late fees and any other fees may only be imposed by a\nhousing judge and they are not considered part of any rent due.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nCurrently many tenants who go into housing court are not informed of\ntheir rights. This bill would ensure that tenants involved in\nnon-payment or eviction proceedings are at least given a list\ninforming them of\ntheir basic rights in the court. Because these proceedings can be very\nintimidating, tenants should be well-informed before they go into\ncourt.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2005-2006: S.7067-A Died in Senate Judiciary Committee\n2007:      S.1806 (Duane), Died in Judiciary\n2008:      S.1806 (Duane), Died in Judiciary\n2009:      S.1524 (Duane), Died in Judiciary\n2010:      S.1524 (Duane), Died in Judiciary\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nMinimal.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after it\nshall have become a law.\n\n",
