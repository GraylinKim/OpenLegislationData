  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2682\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto repeal section 2975-a of the public authorities law,\nrelating to the assessment and\nreimbursement of state expenditures\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nAn act to repeal part UU of Chapter 59\nof the Laws of 2009; relating to the cost recovery assessment placed\non IDAs. The 2009-2010 State Budget contained a maximum $5 million\nstatewide \"cost recovery\" assessment on IDAs to be calculated by\nmultiplying the gross revenues of each IDA for 2008 by 4.7 percent.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThis legislation will repeal certain\nprovisions relating to the assessment and reimbursement of state\nexpenditures and requires reimbursement of monies previously paid.\nAll monies paid by or on behalf of any industrial agency or authority\nas of the effective date of this act to reimburse to New York state\nan allocable share of state governmental costs attributable to the\nprovision of services to industrial development agencies as\ndetermined in section 2975-a of the public authorities law shall be\nreimbursed to the paying entity within ninety days of the effective\ndate of this act.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIDA fee-based income is used to support important\nlocal job creation initiatives, including paying for the operation of\nthe IDA; paying for infrastructure of economic development projects;\nbuilding industrial and technology parks; administering business\nmarketing programs; and conducting job fairs. The IDA tax is\narbitrary, unfair and severely flawed. The tax is applied against\n200B revenue for 2009-2010 services provided to IDAs and there is no\nconceivable way an IDA could have budgeted for this charge. The fee is\nbeing imposed upon revenues statutorily, or agreed upon as\n\"pass-through\" revenues and do not reflect real revenue of the IDA.\nIDAs are required to pay the Bond Insurance Charge, enacted as a cost\nrecovery source of revenue, thereby making the subject tax\nduplicative in purpose and excessive in application furthermore the\n$5 million collected from the \"cost recovery\" charge is more than 300\npercent greater than the total budget of the Authority Budget Office\nand the charge does not reflect any rational basis for actual costs\nincurred by the state for providing services to IDAs. This tax is an\nunfunded mandate which will require municipalities to make larger\ncontributions in support of their economic development\norganization.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010 - S.7073/A.10099 -- CORPS/Corps\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nThis bill will result in the loss of $5 million to\nthe General Fund annually.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately and shall be\ndeemed to have be in full force and effect on and\nafter April 1, 2009.\n\n",
