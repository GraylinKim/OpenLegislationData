  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1511\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the public service law, in relation to requiring inspection and\nregulation of\nall electric and gas meters that measure usage of any end use customer\nof electricity or gas services\nby the public service commission\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nThe purpose of this bill is to require that the Public Service\nCommission has jurisdiction to inspect and regulate all electric and\ngas meters that measure usage of any end use customer of electricity\nor gas services in the same way that PSC currently has oversight of\nmaster meters, or revenue grade meters.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nThis legislation amends subdivision one of section 67 of the public\nservice law, as amended by chapter 446 of the laws of 1972.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nA large number of buildings throughout New York State are currently\nundergoing the process of converting their master metered system to\neither sub or individual meters. This movement is one that policy\nmakers should encourage as an incredibly important and positive part\nof the effort to promote energy conservation and efficiency. However,\none significant gap in the current laws and regulations regarding\nsub-metering is that there currently is no oversight or regulation of\nthe actual sub-meters that are being placed into tenant's apartments.\nThe result is that tenants have no recourse to handle sub-meters that\nare faulty or overcharge, except to take it to the company that\ninstalled them or the management company that hired that company.\nThis bill will require oversight by the Public Service Commission to\nensure that the meters installed are appropriate, not overcharging,\nand meet all other standards set by the PSC.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n2010: S.2348A (Schneiderman) - Finance; A.186B (Hevesi) - Passed\nAssembly\n2009: S.2348A (Schneiderman) - Energy & Telecommunications; A.186B\n(Hevesi)\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after it\nshall have become a law.\n\n\n",
