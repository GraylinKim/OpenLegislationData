  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2215\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the education law and the public health law, in relation to the\ntransfer of patient medical records in\ncertain circumstances\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\n\nThis bill establishes requirement for orderly transfer of medical\nrecords, if a physician closes an office, makes it clear that failure\nto comply with law regarding patient access to his or her own\nrecords is misconduct, and allows the health commissioner to take\nemergency action to require new tests if the failure to release\nrecords timely poses a health threat to individual patients.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\n\nSection 1. Amends subdivision 40 of section 6530 of the education law,\nmake it clear that failure to provide access to records, as required\nby sections 17 and 18 of the public health law, is misconduct.\n\nSection 2. Adds a new subdivision 18-b to the public health law, to\nrequire that a health care provider, health care facility, or health\ncare practitioner, which is ceasing to do business or which is\ntransferring its ownership or otherwise interrupting its services for\na permanent or extended period must notify the commissioner of its\nintent at least sixty days prior, and provide a copy of its plan for\ntransfer of patient records to another provider, facility,\npractitioner or patient, as requested or required pursuant to law.\nThe new section requires the commissioner to prescribe the form of\nsuch plan, the requirements for transfer, and the manner of required\nnotification.\n\nA second provision of this new subdivision states that if the health\ncommissioner determines that the failure of any such health care\nprovider, health care facility, or health care practitioner to timely\nrelease medical records pursuant to law has caused or may cause a\nthreat to the health of the individuals who are the subject of such\nrecords, because more than six months has elapsed since a prior\nscreening or test, the commissioner may order new tests to be\nperformed by a practitioner chosen or\napproved by the commissioner. The language allows the commissioner to\nadvance the costs of these tests and to assess the costs against the\nprovider who failed to comply with law.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nThe bill closes a loophole to provide for continuous custody of\nmedical records. We have unfortunately seen situations in which a\n\nprovider determines to cease operations and fails to provide for\nappropriate transfer of records, and fails to give the records to\npatients who have asked for them. There is no provision in law to\nallow for new tests in a situation in which the records cease to be\nrelevant to the patient's health care situation.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n2010:  S.2188 - Referred to Higher Education\n2008:  S.6638 - Referred to Higher Education\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\n\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nImmediately.\n\n",
