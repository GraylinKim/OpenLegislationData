  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2405\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the executive law, in relation to information on state boards\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo create a centralized compilation of\ninformation about\nstate boards which is available to the public.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection one amends the\nexecutive law by adding\na new section 100-A which defines \"board\" and requires the secretary\nof state to maintain a compilation of the membership, duties, meeting\nand contact information, and products of all state boards. The\nsecretary of state must keep such inventory in a public record\navailable on the Department of State website.\n\nThis section also provides that all boards, or the state agencies they\nadvise, shall annually submit to the secretary of state all\ninformation needed to facilitate these publication requirements, and\nthat the secretary of State must update the list annually.\n\nThis section provides that all boards, or the state agencies they\nadvise, must also provide to the secretary of state on an annual\nbasis all costs associated with these boards for the prior year, and\nanticipated costs for the. coming year, The public can then access\nthis information upon request of the secretary of state.\n\nFinally, the Secretary of State is directed to report to the governor,\nspeaker of the assembly, temporary president of the senate, chair of\nthe assembly oversight, investigations and analysis committee, and\nchair of the senate investigations and government operations\ncommittee on the status of the inventory on or before June 1,2013.\n\nSection two provides the effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nNo complete public inventory of state commissions,\nboards, councils, task forces, or similar bodies exists in New York.\nAs a result, it is difficult, if not impossible, for New Yorkers to\nhave an understanding of existing boards, their composition, purpose\nor legal responsibilities. In fact, the Committee on Oversight,\nAnalysis & Investigation recently completed a review of more than one\nhundred statutorily authorized boards, task forces, and commissions,\nand discovered that only about half have information online, public\nmeetings are listed for only thirty percent, and contact information\nwas readily found for only forty-five percent.\n\nForty-one states have some form of centralized compilation or list of\nstate boards. This legislation would bring New York in line with the\nmajority of states which already provide this information to their\ncitizens, and enable New Yorkers to easily find information about\nboards they are interested in. Overall, this is an important step in\nimproving accountability and increasing government transparency.\n\nThis information will also enable oversight authorities, such as\nlegislative committees, to make recommendations to merge boards with\nduplicative duties and purposes or eliminate non-functioning boards.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nA.10052-A, 2010 Passed Assembly.\nSame as S.7369-A, Passed Senate. Vetoed (Veto No. 6807 of 2010).\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect April 1, 2012.\n\n",
