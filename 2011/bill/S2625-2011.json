  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2625\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to grand larceny and\nunauthorized use of a vehicle and repealing subdivision 1 of\nsection 165.05 of such law relating thereto\n\nPURPOSE/SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nTo increase the penalties for theft of automobiles. This bill amends\nsection 155.35 of the penal law and repeals section 165.05 of the\npenal law.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nSix years ago, the NYS Legislature and then Governor Cuomo recognized\nthat our laws regarding automobile theft were too lenient. Therefore,\nsection 155.30 was amended to include theft of a motor vehicle under\nthe definition of grand larceny in the fourth degree which is a class\nE felony. However, subdivision one of section 165.05 of the penal law\nwas left alone, allowing car theft to still be categorized as\nauthorized use of a vehicle in the third degree which is a class A\nmisdemeanor.\n\nA crime as serious as car theft should receive a proportionate\npunishment. The option of a class A Misdemeanor is inappropriate to\nthe crime and does very little to prevent recidivism. This\nlegislation repeals subdivision one of section 165.05 dealing with\nunauthorized use of a vehicle and amends section 155.35 to make\nsecond offense for auto theft a class D felony. By repealing\nsubdivision one of section 165.05 the first offense for auto theft\nwould be a class E felony.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect the first of November next succeeding the\ndate on which it shall become law.\n\n",
