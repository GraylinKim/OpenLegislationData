  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1919\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nCONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY\nproposing an amendment to section 14 of article 3 of the\nconstitution, in relation to the\nprocedure for voting increases in the rate of state taxes\n\nPURPOSE:\nRequires two-thirds vote of legislature for any increase, extension,\nimposition or restoration of any tax, fee, assessment, surcharge or\nany other such levy change.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThis legislation is a constitutional amendment which would require a\ntwo-third's majority vote, rather than a simple majority vote in the\nSenate and Assembly for any increase, extension, imposition or\nrestoration of any tax, fee, assessment, surcharge or any other such\nlevy change.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nCurrently, only a majority vote is required for legislation to be\npassed which raises new revenue. This legislation would require broad\nand overwhelming support for any revenue increase to ensure that the\nincreased revenue was truly vital to the entire State. It will be one\nmore tool in restraining the runaway budget spending that we saw over\nthe past couple of years and it will help curtail the use of New\nYork's taxpayers as the State's ATM.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nThis is a new bill.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nWill force the State to live within its current means.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nResolved (if the assembly concur), That the foregoing\namendments be referred to the first regular legislative session\nconvening after the next succeeding general election of members\nof the assembly, and, in conformity with section 1 of article\n19 of the constitution, be published for 3 months previous to the\ntime of such election.\n\n",
