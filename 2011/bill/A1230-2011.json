Subdivisions 1, 4, and 8 of section 5-208 of  the  election\n    2  law, subdivisions 1 and 8 as amended by chapter 200 of the laws of 1996,\n    3  subdivision  4  as added by chapter 659 of the laws of 1994, are amended\n    4  to read as follows:\n    5    1. The board of elections shall transfer the registration and  enroll-\n    6  ment  of any voter for whom it receives a notice of change of address to\n    7  another address in [the same county or city] NEW YORK STATE, or for  any\n    8  voter  who  casts  a  ballot  in an affidavit ballot envelope which sets\n    9  forth such a new address.  Such notices shall include, but not be limit-\n   10  ed to, notices received from any state agency  which  conducts  a  voter\n   11  registration  program  pursuant  to the provisions of sections 5-211 and\n   12  5-212 of this title, that the voter has notified such agency of a change\n   13  of address in [the same city or county] NEW YORK STATE unless the  voter\n   14  has  indicated that such change of address is not for voter registration\n   15  purposes, notices of change of address from  the  United  States  Postal\n   16  Service  through the National Change of Address System, any notices of a\n   17  forwarding address on mail sent to a voter by the board of elections and\n   18  returned by the postal service, national  or  state  voter  registration\n   19  forms, confirmation mailing response cards, United States Postal Service\n   20  notices  to correspondents of change of address, applications for regis-\n   21  tration from persons already registered in [such  county  or  city]  NEW\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD01121-01-1\n\n       A. 1230                             2\n\n    1  YORK  STATE, or any other notices to correspondents sent to the board of\n    2  elections by such voters.\n    3    4.  If  such  application for registration from a voter already regis-\n    4  tered in [such county or city] NEW YORK STATE also reflects a change  of\n    5  enrollment,  the  board  of elections shall treat such application as an\n    6  application for change of enrollment pursuant to section 5-304  of  this\n    7  article.\n    8    8.  If  the  board of elections receives notice of a change of address\n    9  within [such city or county] NEW YORK STATE from, or with respect to,  a\n   10  person  who it determines is not registered in [such county or city] NEW\n   11  YORK STATE, it shall forthwith send such person a notice to that  effect\n   12  in  a  form  approved by the state board of elections at the new address\n   13  set forth in such notice of change of address,  together  with  a  voter\n   14  registration form.\n   15    S  2.  Subparagraph  (ii) of paragraph (e) of subdivision 3 of section\n   16  8-302 of the election law, as amended by chapter  164  of  the  laws  of\n   17  2010, is amended to read as follows:\n   18    (ii) He or she may swear to and subscribe an affidavit stating that he\n   19  or  she  has  duly  registered  to  vote,  the  address in such election\n   20  district from which he or she registered, that he or she remains a  duly\n   21  qualified  voter in such election district, that his or her registration\n   22  poll record appears to be lost or misplaced or  that  his  or  her  name\n   23  and/or  his  or  her  signature  was omitted from the computer generated\n   24  registration list or that he or she has  moved  within  [the  county  or\n   25  city]  NEW  YORK STATE since he or she last registered, the address from\n   26  which he or she was previously registered and the address at which he or\n   27  she currently resides, and at a primary election, the party in which  he\n   28  or she is enrolled. The inspectors of election shall offer such an affi-\n   29  davit  to  each  such  voter whose residence address is in such election\n   30  district.  Each such affidavit shall be in  a  form  prescribed  by  the\n   31  state  board  of  elections, shall be printed on an envelope of the size\n   32  and quality used for an absentee ballot envelope, and shall  contain  an\n   33  acknowledgment  that  the  affiant  understands that any false statement\n   34  made  therein  is  perjury  punishable  according  to  law.  Such   form\n   35  prescribed  by  the  state  board of elections shall request information\n   36  required to register such voter should the county board  determine  that\n   37  such  voter  is  not  registered  and shall constitute an application to\n   38  register to vote. The voter's name and the entries required  shall  then\n   39  be  entered  without  delay  and  without  further inquiry in the fourth\n   40  section of the challenge report or in the place provided at the  end  of\n   41  the  computer  generated  registration  list, with the notation that the\n   42  voter has executed the affidavit hereinabove  prescribed,  or,  if  such\n   43  person's  name  appears on the computer generated registration list, the\n   44  board of elections may provide a place to make such entry next to his or\n   45  her name on such list.  The voter shall then, without  further  inquiry,\n   46  be  permitted  to vote an affidavit ballot provided for by this chapter.\n   47  Such ballot shall thereupon be placed in the envelope containing his  or\n   48  her  affidavit,  and  the  envelope  sealed and returned to the board of\n   49  elections in the manner provided by this chapter for protested  official\n   50  ballots, including a statement of the number of such ballots.\n   51    S 3. This act shall take effect immediately.\n",
