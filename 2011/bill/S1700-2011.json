SAMPSON -- read twice and ordered printed, and when\n         printed to be committed to the Committee on Education\n\n       AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to establishing  a  pilot\n         program  for  overage, under-credit students to prepare these students\n         for post secondary education or training and providing for the  repeal\n         of such provisions upon expiration thereof\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and\n    2  declares  it  necessary  to  increase the graduation rate in this state,\n    3  particularly New York City, Yonkers, Buffalo, Rochester,  and  Syracuse,\n    4  where the drop-out rate is exceptionally high particularly with minority\n    5  and limited English proficient students. To do so, the legislature finds\n    6  it necessary to create a research-based pilot program to assist overage,\n    7  under-credit  students,  who  are  typically  at risk of not graduating,\n    8  obtain a high school diploma or general equivalency diploma  (GED),  and\n    9  to  prepare these students for post-secondary education or training. The\n   10  legislature recognizes that  a  variety  of  individual,  familial,  and\n   11  community-based  factors may contribute to a student's failure to gradu-\n   12  ate, including, but not limited to, the student's poor academic perform-\n   13  ance or attendance, parents' academic history, alcohol and/or  substance\n   14  abuse  in  the  home,  upbringing  in  a single parent household or teen\n   15  parent  household,  neglect  and/or  abuse  in  the  home,  insufficient\n   16  parental  interest  or involvement in students' academic performance, or\n   17  otherwise, limited English proficiency in the home,  limited  access  to\n   18  health  care,  or  limited economic means, poverty or parental unemploy-\n   19  ment.\n   20    The pilot program will examine the relationship between the  aforemen-\n   21  tioned  risk  factors and the students' academic progress as well as the\n   22  influence of the program's academic and after school support services on\n   23  the student's academic progress, post-secondary education  or  training,\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD05907-01-1\n\n       S. 1700                             2\n\n    1  and  employability. The pilot program is expected to engage one thousand\n    2  two hundred eligible students in academic and after-school services. The\n    3  pilot program will provide assistance and support to  selected  students\n    4  to  assist  them  to  obtain a high school diploma or GED and to prepare\n    5  them for post-secondary education or training. The program will  further\n    6  provide  assistance  and support to the students for two years after the\n    7  students' attainment  of  such  a  diploma.  This  research-based  pilot\n    8  program  will  provide  a comprehensive look at the needs of and adverse\n    9  influences on overage, under-credit students and provide  a  fundamental\n   10  plan for remediation.\n   11    S  2.

  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1700\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the education law, in relation to establishing a pilot program\nfor overage, under-credit students to prepare these students for post\nsecondary education or training and providing for the repeal of such\nprovisions upon expiration thereof\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 establishes a new article 100 in the education law which\ncreates a pilot program for overage, under-credited students as\nfollows:\n\n*Section 4950 *\n\n1. Legislative Intent\n\n2. The program is directed at ages 12 to 22, overage, under-credited\nyouth in grades seven to twelve, with continuous support after\ngraduation or GED attainment. Eligible youth typically will have one\nor more research-based risk factors.\n\n*Section 4951 *\n\nCreates a pilot program to support a research-driven, comprehensive\nprogram for overage, under-credited youth in the Big Five City school\ndistricts to obtain a high school diploma or equivalent, as well as\nmake an effective transition to employment or postsecondary level\ntraining.\nThe program will be piloted with 1,200 students; 600 will be in New\nYork City, and 150 in each in Buffalo, Syracuse, Rochester, and\nYonkers.\n\n*Section 4952 *\n\nEach school district application must include a consortia of community\nbased organizations, postsecondary institutions, businesses, unions,\nadult education programs or other organizations to connect neighborhood\nservices with youth and families.\n\n*Section 4953 *\n\nActivities in the program shall include:\n\n1. A full-time paid advocate\n\n2. Academic and after-school support\n\n3. Wrap-around support services\n\n4. Part-time paid, year-round employment and scholarships\n\n5. Workplace supervisor and mentor\n\n6. A clear pathway to postsecondary education or career\n\n7. Family engagement and strengthening\n\n*Section 4954 * Cost of the program:\n\n-$2,500 per pupil for advocacy, scholarships, work experience and\nmentoring\n\n- $.3,500 per pupil for wrap-around support services, academic\nsupport, and family engagement\n\n-$700 per parent to participate in adult education\n\n-Employment preparation education state aid for eligible parents over\nage 21 used as a match\n\n-$500,000 for outcome evaluation\n\n* Section 4955 *\n\nAnticipated Results:\n\n1. All students graduate high school or obtain a GED\n\n2. Students are prepared for the workforce\n\n3. Increased number of students successfully transitioning to\npostsecondary education\n\n4. Reduces turnover costs for employers\n\n5. Keeps New York State talent in New York State\n\n6. Stabilizes families\n\n7. Lowers the incarceration rate\n\nSection 2 appropriates the sum of $8,450,000.\n\nSection 3 states the effective date (immediately) and provides that\nthe act be repealed 5 years from the effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nOverage, under-credited students are concentrated in schools and\ncommunities with the greatest challenges in improving student\nachievement. In fact, according to the NYC Department of Education's\nOffice of Multiple Pathways, there are approximately 140, 000\n\nunder-credited students between the ages of 16-21 in New York City\nalone. These students represent 20% of all high school students\nenrolled in city schools. In the state's Big Five School Districts,\nnearly 70% of minority and limited English proficient 7th graders\nfail to graduate by the 12th grade. The vast majority of over-aged,\nunder-credited students end up dropping out of school, going to jail,\nor aging out of the system without earning a high school diploma or\nOED. In fact, 75% of all state prison inmates have not completed high\nschool and individuals without a high school diploma are 60% more\nlikely to use TANF, 80% more likely to use food stamps, and more\nlikely to use public housing than are high school graduates. In\naddition, for each cohort of 18 year olds that do not complete high\nschool, the U.S. loses $192 billion dollars (1.6% of the GDP) in tax\nrevenues alone. This puts an enormous burden not only on these\nstudents and their families but on their communities, t\nhe state, and the nation as well. This bill is an outgrowth of\ncontinual discussions I have had with the NYS Department of Education\nto address over-aged, under-credited students. This bill establishes\na comprehensive program targeting high risk, over-aged,\nunder-credited students ages 12-22 in the Big Five City School\nDistricts. The program will provide academic and after-school\nsupport; community based social, health, and career services;\nemployment and workplace mentoring; and family engagement to support\nstudents and ensure they graduate from high school and are prepared\nfor postsecondary education or the workforce.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.7494 of 2008\n04/08/08 Referred to Education\nS.146 of 2009\n01/07/09 REFERRED TO EDUCATION\n01/06/]0 REFERRED TO EDUCATION\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\nThe State Education Department estimates the cost of this program to\nbe $8.54 million.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately, with provisions.\n\n",
