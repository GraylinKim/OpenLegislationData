  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2767\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the executive law, in relation to requiring state and municipal\nagencies, authorities, boards and commissions that collect demographic\ndata as to the ancestry or origins of state residents to utilize a\nseparate collection and tabulation category entitled \"Asian or Pacific\nIslander\" for the purpose of identifying persons having origins in any\nof the Far East countries, South East Asia, the Indian subcontinent or\nthe Pacific Islands\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo amend the executive law, in relation to requiring state\nand municipal agencies, authorities, boards and commissions that\ncollect demographic data.as to the ancestry or origins of state\nresidents to utilize a separate collection and tabulation category\nentitled \"Asian or Pacific Islander\" for the purpose of identifying\npersons having origins in any of the Far East countries, South East\nAsia, the Indian subcontinent or the Pacific Islands.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nOftentimes, agencies omit the Asian or Pacific Islander\ncategory when collecting demographics, and are often categorized\ninstead as \"Others\". Since Asian or Pacific Islanders constitute\napproximately 7 percent of the State's population and approximately\n13 percent of New York City's population, it is difficult to\ndetermine whether or not such agencies are identifying the needs of\nthis specific racial demographic, and when categorized as \"Others\",\ntheir needs are left unmet.\n\nFor example, in the New York State Department of Health's \"The Impact\nof Oral Disease\" report from December 2006, Table VI, titled\n\"Percentage of People who Had Their Teeth Cleaned within the Past\nYear Aged 18 and Older\", Asians are not categorized in the\nethnicities, and are therefore listed as \"Other\". Additionally, in\nthe New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services' 200$ report\non Domestic Homicide in New York State neglected to categorize the\nvictimized Asian population.\n\nThis bill only affects agencies that presently already collect\ndemographic data.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nSenate\n2009-10:  S.7665 - Referred to Finance\n\nAssembly.\n2009-10:  A.9973 (Meng) Referred to Governmental Operations\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
