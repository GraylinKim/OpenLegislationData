It is hereby further found and determined that: (i) the village\n    8  of Black River,  county  of  Jefferson,  exceeded  its  maximum  project\n    9  authorization  pursuant to section 32.00 of the local finance law during\n   10  a period from 2008 to 2010 where the money  received  on  the  long-term\n   11  USDA funding of $1,271,000.00 was outstanding at the same time as it was\n   12  part  of the short-term financing from EFC during which time the maximum\n   13  amount of financing that was outstanding on  the  project  exceeded  the\n   14  maximum  project cost authorization of the $5,000,000.00 bond resolution\n   15  dated March 28, 2005; (ii) the village made principal  payments  on  the\n   16  EFC  short-term  financing bond anticipation note of $80,451.00 in 2008,\n   17  $19,491.75 in 2009, and $19,000.00 in 2010;  (iii)  sections  21.00  and\n   18  23.00 of the local finance law state that no annual installment of bonds\n   19  or  bond  anticipation  notes shall be more than fifty per centum of the\n   20  smallest prior installment; (iv) the village's underpayment on  the  EFC\n   21  note  in  2009 and 2010 renders it incapable of amortizing any long-term\n   22  conversion of the short-term EFC financing to comply with the  aforesaid\n   23  fifty  per  centum requirements of sections 21.00 and 23.00 of the local\n   24  finance law.\n   25    S 3. Notwithstanding the defects described in section one of this act,\n   26  to the extent that the village of Black  River  exceeded  their  maximum\n   27  project  authorization, such amounts are hereby legalized, validated and\n   28  ratified.\n   29    S 4. Notwithstanding the defects described in section two of this act,\n   30  to the extent that the village of Black River underpaid the principal of\n   31  the note, such underpayment is hereby forgiven and the village shall  be\n   32  authorized to pay the deficient amount during the balance of the life of\n   33  the loan.\n   34    S  5.  Except as otherwise provided in this act, the bond notes issued\n   35  under authority of the bond resolutions described in section one of this\n   36  act shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  issued  in  accordance  with  the\n   37  provisions of the local finance law.\n   38    S  6.  If any clause, sentence, subdivision, paragraph or part of this\n   39  act be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction  to  be  invalid,\n   40  such judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remainder ther-\n   41  eof,  but  shall  be  confined in its operation to the clause, sentence,\n   42  subdivision, paragraph, section or part thereof directly involved in the\n   43  controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered.\n   44    S 7. This act shall take effect immediately.\n",
