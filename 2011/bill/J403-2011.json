and\n  WHEREAS, A 1999 graduate of Ellenville  High  School,  1st  Lieutenant\nDavid Provencher's platoon was serving as the quick reaction force for a\njoint  United  States  Special  Forces and Afghan National Army commando\noperation in the volatile northern Afghanistan province of Kunduz on the\nmorning of June 16, 2010; and\n  WHEREAS, During the operation, the Special  Forces  units  suffered  a\nseries  of weapons malfunctions that jeopardized the mission; Lieutenant\nDavid Provencher moved his platoon forward and established  two  mounted\npositions  with his vehicles; he then dismounted and moved on foot meet-\ning up with the Special Forces Team Leader to gain a better idea of  the\nbattlefield situation and to identify security positions; and\n  WHEREAS,  Exposing himself to enemy fire, Lieutenant David Provencher,\nfrom his vantage point, was able to identify enemy fighters moving  into\npositions north and west of his platoon's location; once again, he moved\nthrough  enemy  fire to emplace his men in security positions; his rapid\nemplacement of troops, and their precise fire, halted the enemy advance,\ncausing a lull in the fighting; and\n  WHEREAS, With a perimeter  established,  Lieutenant  David  Provencher\ngathered  three  wounded  engineers and led them to a Special Operations\nForces medic; before returning to his embattled troops, he  ensured  the\nwounded were being treated and readied for evacuation;

they are the true\ndefenders of democracy and democratic ideals; and\n  WHEREAS,  The  banner of freedom will always wave over our beloved New\nYork and all of America, the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave;\nand\n  WHEREAS, Residents of this great State must never forget  the  courage\nwith  which  these men and women serve their country, and must recognize\nthat no greater debt is owed than that owed  to  those  who  risk  their\nlives for their beloved Nation; and\n  WHEREAS,  The  freedoms and security we cherish as Americans come at a\nvery high price for those serving in the military in times of  conflict;\nit is fitting and proper that we, who are the beneficiaries of the cour-\nage  of  those  who  risk  their  lives,  leaving their families behind,\nexpress our appreciation and eternal gratitude for their sacrifices  and\ncourageous acts; now, therefore, be it\n  RESOLVED,  That  this  Legislative  Body pause in its deliberations to\nhonor 1st Lieutenant David Provencher upon the occasion  of  his  desig-\nnation  as a recipient of a Silver Star from the United States Army;
