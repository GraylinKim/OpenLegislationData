  "fulltext" : "\nLEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION paying tribute to the life and accomplishments of\nRosa Parks, a pioneer of the Civil Rights Movement\n\nWHEREAS,  It is with profound intent that this Legislative Body is moved\nto pay homage to a woman  of  indomitable  faith  and  dedication  whose\npurposeful life and accomplishments will forever stand as a paradigm and\ninspiration for others; and\n  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to give acclaim to\nindividuals of great character whose lives exemplify the highest  ideals\nof humanity; and\n  WHEREAS,  Rosa  Parks,  a Black seamstress whose refusal to relinquish\nher seat to a White man on a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama, on  Decem-\nber  1,  1955,  grew into a mythic event that helped touch off the civil\nrights movement of the 1950s and 1960s; and\n  WHEREAS, For her act of defiance, Rosa Parks was  arrested,  convicted\nof  violating the segregation laws and fined $10, plus $4 in court fees;\nin response, Blacks in Montgomery,  Alabama,  boycotted  the  buses  for\nnearly  13 months while mounting a successful Supreme Court challenge to\nthe Jim Crow law that enforced their second-class status on  the  public\nbus system; and\n  WHEREAS,  The  events  that  began  on  that bus in the winter of 1955\ncaptivated the nation and transformed a 26-year-old preacher  named  Dr.\nMartin  Luther  King,  Jr.  into a major civil rights leader; it was Dr.\nKing, the new pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in  Montgomery,\nAlabama, who was drafted to head the Montgomery Improvement Association,\nthe organization formed to direct the nascent civil rights struggle; and\n  WHEREAS,  Rosa Parks's act of civil disobedience, which seems a simple\ngesture of defiance so many years later, was in fact a  dangerous,  even\nreckless  move  in  1950s Alabama; in refusing to move, she risked legal\nsanction and perhaps even physical harm, but she also  set  into  motion\nsomething  beyond the control of the city authorities; Mrs. Parks clari-\nfied for people far beyond Montgomery, Alabama, the cruelty and  humili-\nation inherent in the laws and customs of segregation; and\n  WHEREAS,  That  moment  on the Cleveland Avenue bus also turned a very\nprivate woman into a reluctant symbol and torchbearer in the  quest  for\nracial  equality  in  a  movement that became increasingly organized and\nsophisticated in making demands and getting results; and\n  WHEREAS, The truth, as Rosa Parks later explained, was  that  she  was\ntired  of  being  humiliated, of having to adapt to the byzantine rules,\nsome codified as law and others passed on as tradition, that  reinforced\nthe position of Blacks as something less than full human beings; and\n  WHEREAS,  A true civil rights icon, Rosa Parks died a little more than\na month short of the 50th Anniversary of her courageous act  which  many\nview as the beginning of the civil rights movement; and\n  WHEREAS,  Rosa  Parks's  pure  legacy  of quiet and peaceful rebellion\nagainst hatred will live on for many years to come; and\n  WHEREAS, Armed with a  humanistic  spirit,  imbued  with  a  sense  of\ncompassion, and comforted by numerous admirers, Rosa Parks leaves behind\na legacy which will long endure the passage of time and will remain as a\ncomforting  memory  to all she served and befriended; now, therefore, be\nit\n  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to pay\ntribute to the life and accomplishments of Rosa Parks, a pioneer of  the\nCivil Rights Movement.\n",
