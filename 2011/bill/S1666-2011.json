  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1666\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law,\nin relation to criminal mischief in certain cases\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nExpands the scope of the crime of criminal mischief to include cases\nwherein a person intentionally damages property of another with the\nintent to harass, annoy, or alarm, in order to address cases of\ndomestic violence that include property damage.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 of the bill amends the Penal Law sections 145.00; 145.05, and\n145.10, to add an element to each count of criminal mischief to cover\na situation where a person, with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm\nanother person, intentionally damages property in which the other\nperson has a possessory or proprietary interest, which property may\ninclude marital property. Section 2 of the bill amends the Criminal\nProcedure Law to add criminal mischief to the list of family\noffenses. Section 3 of the bill amends the Family Court Act to add\ncriminal mischief to the list of family offenses.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThis law corrects the holding in PEOPLE v. PERSON 658 N.Y.S.2d .372\n(2nd Dep't 1997) that a husband can not be charged with criminal\nmischief when he destroys the personal property of his estranged wife\nbecause the property was marital property in which the husband had a\nproprietary interest. In that case, Mr. Person forcibly entered Ms.\nPerson's dwelling, assaulted her, and destroyed her clothing,\ntoiletries, the contents of her handbag, and various items of\nhousehold furnishings. Although convicted of criminal mischief in the\nfourth degree at the trial level, the Appellate Division reversed,\nholding that \"because the defendant had an equitable interest in the\nitems he was charged with damaging or stealing... he could not be\ncharged with these crimes.\" The PERSON case misapplies the Domestic\nRelations Law, which defines marital property for purposes of\nequitable distribution, to a domestic violence crime under the Penal\nLaw. As the New York State Commission on Domestic\nViolence Fatalities stated in its 1997 report to the Governor: \"The\ncourt in PERSON appears to have equated marital property for purposes\nof distribution between the parties Upon divorce, with household\nproperty in which a spouse has at least a proprietary interest. The\nexplanatory comment published with the Criminal Mischief sections of\nthe Penal Law states: 'Property is that of another person... if\nanyone, other than the defendant, has a possessory or proprietary\ninterest in such tangible property. The Commission recommended\nlegislation to clarify that the criminal mischief sections of the\nPenal Law do apply when a person destroys marital or jointly owned\nproperty, committing a form of domestic violence. Aggressors in\n\ndomestic disputes often commit domestic violence by destroying or\ndamaging property of their victim with the intent to harass, annoy,\nor alarm. This type of behavior is a form of domestic violence which\nthe PERSON case in effect sanctions. The case directly contradicts\nthe strong public policy in this State of protecting the victims of\ndomestic violence. The bill implements this policy by amending each\ncount of criminal mischief to include sanctions where a person has a\npossessory or proprietary interest with the\nintent to annoy, harass or alarm that other person. Lastly, the bill\nincludes the crime of criminal mischief in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th\ndegree in the list of crimes that can constitute a family offense\nunder the Criminal Procedure Law and the Family Court Act so that\nvictims of this form of domestic violence have the option of going to\nFamily Court for an order of protection when a person commits\ndomestic violence by destroying property.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.7612 of 2008\n04/17/08 Referred to Codes\nS.124 of 2009\n01/07/09 REFERRED TO CODES\n01/06/10 REFERRED TO CODES\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the first of November next succeeding the\ndate on which it shall have become law.\n\n",
