PARKER -- read twice and ordered printed, and when\n         printed to be committed to the Committee on Finance\n\n       AN ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to ensuring equal  access\n         to health and human services for limited English speaking individuals\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Declaration of legislative findings and intent. Title VI of\n    2  the civil rights act of 1964 provides in pertinent part that \"no  person\n    3  in  the  United  States  shall  on the ground of race, color or national\n    4  origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or\n    5  be subjected to discrimination under any program or  activity  receiving\n    6  federal  assistance.\"  The  United  States department of justice and the\n    7  department of health and human services  have  stated  that  failure  to\n    8  provide  language  assistance  to  limited  English speaking individuals\n    9  seeking assistance in federally funded, state supervised or administered\n   10  programs amounts to a violation of Title VI  by  discriminating  against\n   11  such individuals based upon their national origin.\n   12    It  is  and has been the policy of the state of New York to oppose all\n   13  forms of discrimination, particularly when it relates to  the  provision\n   14  of state services, or locally provided services under state supervision.\n   15  However,  the  department  of  health and human services office of civil\n   16  rights, the office responsible for enforcing Title VI in  department  of\n   17  health  and  human  services  programs,  found  that  the New York state\n   18  departments of temporary and disability assistance, the New  York  state\n   19  department  of health, the New York City human resources administration,\n   20  and the departments of social services in Nassau  and  Suffolk  counties\n   21  were in violation of Title VI based upon the state and counties' failure\n   22  to  provide interpretation services for limited English proficient indi-\n   23  viduals. Specifically, the office of civil  rights  found  that  limited\n   24  English proficient clients seeking and/or applying for subsistence bene-\n   25  fits such as food stamps and public assistance for children and Medicaid\n   26  benefits  were  routinely  unable  to  access such benefits due to their\n   27  inability to speak English.\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD02168-01-1\n\n       S. 1736                             2\n\n    1    A legislative hearing on immigrant child  welfare  issues  also  found\n    2  that  the  lack of interpreters in child welfare cases resulted in chil-\n    3  dren in families who were limited English proficient were  unnecessarily\n    4  removed  from  their  parents.  In  addition, limited English proficient\n    5  residents  of New York have been unable to access unemployment and other\n    6  services from the department of labor due  to  the  lack  of  translated\n    7  materials  and  interpreters.  The  New  York equal access to health and\n    8  human services for limited English speaking  individuals  act  serves  a\n    9  twofold  purpose:    first,  the  act  will  ensure that the state is in\n   10  compliance with federal law in ensuring access to benefits and  opportu-\n   11  nities  to  participate  in  any  program  or activity receiving federal\n   12  assistance; second, and more importantly, the act will ensure  that  all\n   13  those in need of health and human services receive them, and that no one\n   14  attempting  to  access such services will be discriminated against based\n   15  upon the language they speak.\n   16    S 2. The executive law is amended by adding a new article 14-A to read\n   17  as follows:\n   18                                ARTICLE 14-A\n   19        EQUAL ACCESS TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES FOR LIMITED ENGLISH\n   20                            SPEAKING INDIVIDUALS\n   21  SECTION 275.
