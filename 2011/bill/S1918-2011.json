  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1918\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the parks, recreation and historic preservation law, in\nrelation to requiring an evaluation of the impacts of the closure of\npublic access to any land owned or operated by the office of parks,\nrecreation and historic preservation\n\nPURPOSE OF THE BILL:\nThe bill would require the conduct of public\nhearings and reports thereon prior to the closure of any real\nproperty by OPRHP.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThe bill would add a new Section 13.14 of the\nParks, Recreation and Historic Preservation Law to require the agency\nto prepare a draft report that provides justification and the\nrationale for the closure of public access of any real property owned\nor operations by OPRHP, at least six months prior to a proposed\nclosure of such lands.\nThe bill specifies the elements of the report, which must be subject\nto one of more public hearings at least 4 months prior to such\nproposed closure, with at least one public hearing in the impacted\narea. OPRHP must issue a final report that includes a response to all\nissues raised at the hearings; the report must be publicly available\nand submitted to the Governor and the Legislature.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIf OPRHP proposes to close to the public any park,\nhistoric preservation site, bird conservation area or other facility\nunder its jurisdiction, the agency should be required to evaluate and\nsupport such proposed closure and its impact on the public. Public\nreview and public hearings will offer the opportunity for public\nscrutiny of such proposals, and if a proposed closure is not\nadequately supported by the agency, it should not go forward.\nProviding this information to the Governor and the Legislature will\nallow them to responds to such actions as well. Protection of our\npriceless natural and public recreation resources is paramount.\nClosures can result in vandalism, deterioration of the infrastructure\nand other damage that would go undetected and not corrected. The\nState has a significant investment in the State park system that must\nbe protected for the benefit of all of the citizens of NYS.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-2010: A.10452 DelMonte, Passed Assembly unanimously. Senate -\nDied in Finance\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\n\nThere would be\ncosts associated with the preparation of the report and conduct of\none or more public hearings.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act would take effect immediately.\n\n",
