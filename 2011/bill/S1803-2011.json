Legislative intent.  In order to protect the public health,\n    2  safety  and  welfare  of  the citizens who desire naturopathic care, the\n    3  legislature finds it is necessary to regulate the practice of  naturopa-\n    4  thy by providing licensure for qualified practitioners. It is the legis-\n    5  lature's  intent that only practitioners who meet and maintain standards\n    6  of competence are recognized by the public as licensed naturopaths.  The\n    7  legislature   recognizes   that,   unlike   other   currently   licensed\n    8  professions, naturopathic doctors are formally educated in  the  use  of\n    9  natural therapies, natural substances and pharmacological substances for\n   10  common  health conditions and disease prevention.  Naturopaths serve the\n   11  public as experts in drug/nutrient and drug/herb interactions.\n   12    S 2.
