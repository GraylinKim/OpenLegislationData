  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1952\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public authorities law, in relation to prohibiting the\nimposition of a toll on\nintra-borough bridges\n\nSUMMARY:\nAmends section five hundred fifty-three of the public\nAuthorities Law by adding a new subdivision twelve-a, prohibiting\nthe imposition of a toll or fee for the use of any intra-borough\nbridge.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nTo require a toll on an intra-borough bridge divides\ncommunities, neighborhoods and prohibits access to local services. It\nis a grossly unfair policy to allow tolls on such bridges. such a\ntoll creates a negative impact on communities by requiring\nindividuals to pay a toll several times a day just to accomplish\nnormal, everyday chores.\nThis is wholly different from the usual bridge toll which is\nencountered only twice daily by workers to and from their place of\nemployment.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nUndetermined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the sixtieth day after it shall have\nbecome a law.\n\n",
