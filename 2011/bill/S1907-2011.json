  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1907\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the election law, in relation to disqualification of\ncandidates who fail to file personal financial disclosure statements\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nTo insure that candidates for public office fully disclose their\npersonal financial ties and investments as required by the Ethics in\nGovernment law.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nA new section 6-123 is added to the election law, which would\ndisqualify candidates for public office who fail to file an annual\nstatement of financial disclosure as required by the public officers\nlaw.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIn 1987 the Legislature enacted stringent financial reporting\nrequirements in the Ethics in Government law. Pursuant to this law,\nincumbent officeholders must file personal financial disclosure\nstatements by May 15. However, non-incumbent challenger candidates do\nnot have to file their disclosure statements until after they have\nfiled their designating or nominating petitions or certificates of\nnomination (usually in July, August or September).\n\nA challenger candidate could avoid any opportunity for the public, the\npress, or the opposing candidate, to scrutinize his disclosure\nstatement by filing a couple weeks late, or not at all until after\nthe election.\nYet the same challenger candidate has access to the incumbent's\nstatement months before the election.\n\nCommitment to the highest ethical standards require that candidates\nfor public office should disclose their financial dealings prior to\nthe election in order for the voters to be fully aware of any\npossible conflicts of interest, or they should forfeit their place on\nthe ballot.\n\nThe public's opportunity to choose a candidate will be preserved since\na substitution would be permitted for the disqualified candidate.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThirtieth day after it shall have become a law, with provisions.\n\n",
