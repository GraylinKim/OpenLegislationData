Paragraph g of subdivision 3 of section 467-b of the real\n    2  property tax law, as amended by section 1 of chapter 188 of the laws  of\n    3  2005, is amended to read as follows:\n    4    g. notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, where a\n    5  head  of  the household holds a current, valid tax abatement certificate\n    6  and, after the effective date of this paragraph, there  is  a  permanent\n    7  decrease  in  the  combined income of all members of the household in an\n    8  amount which exceeds twenty percent of such  income  as  represented  in\n    9  such  head of the household's last approved application for a tax abate-\n   10  ment certificate or for renewal thereof, such head of the household  may\n   11  apply for a redetermination of the amount set forth therein.

  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1224\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act to amend the real property tax law, in relation to tax abatement\nfor rent-controlled and rent regulated property occupied by senior citi-\nzens or persons with disabilities\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nMakes rent re-determinations under the Senior Citizen Rent Increase\nExemption Program (SCRIE) and the Disability Rent Increase Exemption\nProgram (DRIE) retroactive to the time of the decrease in income of the\nhousehold.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThis bill will amend subdivision g of section 467-b(3) of the real prop-\nerty tax law by adding the following language: when a re-determination\nof the adjusted rent has been made pursuant to this paragraph, such\nre-determination shall be made retroactive to the date there was a\npermanent decrease in the combined income of all members of the house-\nhold.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe SCRIE and DRIE programs provide exemption for low income senior\ncitizen and disabled tenants from certain rent increases. Senior citi-\nzens and disabled citizens who lose an income earning spouse and have\nbeen benefiting from the SCRIE or DRIE programs, are entitled to a rede-\ntermination of their rent based on their now lower income. Unfortunate-\nly, because the re-determination process takes time, widowed seniors or\npersons with disabilities may be left paying a higher rent than they can\nnow afford. This legislation makes the lower re-determined rent retroac-\ntive to the date of the loss of income, allowing widowed, low income\nseniors or persons with disabilities to maintain their apartments.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nThis bill was previously introduced.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately; provided that the amendments to\nsection 467-b of the real property tax law made by this section shall\nnot affect the expiration of such section pursuant to section 17 of\nchapter 576 of the laws of 1974, as amended, and shall be deemed to\nexpire therewith.\n\n",
