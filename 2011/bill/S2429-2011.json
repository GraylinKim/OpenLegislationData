  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2429\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the transportation law, in relation to the erection of certain\ntowers on special parkway lands\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis bill prohibits the commissioner of transportation to grant any\nerection of communication towers/cell towers on special parkway lands\nwithout the consent of the local government in which such lands are\nlocated. This bill prohibits the commissioner of transportation to\ngrant any erection of communication towers/cell towers on special\nparkway lands without the consent of the local government in which\nsuch lands are located.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nAmends the transportation law by adding a new section 71-a that states\nthe commissioner shall not erect, cause or permit to be erected,\ngrant easements or licenses for, or facilitate the erection of any\ntower on special parkway lands, including cellular/PCS towers,\nwithout the consent of the local government in which such lands are\nlocated. This shall conform in all respects to any and all local\nlaws, ordinances, resolutions, rules, and regulations.\n\n\"Special Parkways\" are parkways located in Westchester County,\nincluding the Hutchinson River Parkway, the Saw Mill River Parkway,\nthe Cross County Parkway, the Taconic Parkway, and the Sprain Brook\nParkway.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIn cases where the State determines communication towers, including\ncell towers, are to be erected on special parkway lands, it should\nrecognize the traditional role of local governments as purveyors of\nland use policy. This can only be accomplished by requiring consent\nfrom the applicable local government be granted to the State before\nallowing such permanent and readily observable towers to be erected.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n04/24/09 REFERRED TO TRANSPORTATION\n01/06/10 REFERRED TO TRANSPORTATION\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
