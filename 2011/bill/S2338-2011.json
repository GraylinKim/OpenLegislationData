  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2338\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the real property tax law, in relation to school tax relief\nprogram (STAR) savings\ncalculation\n\nPURPOSE OF THE BILL:\nTo give equal STAR relief to homeowners who pay\ntheir school taxes in part through sales tax revenue\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThis bill amends subdivision 2 of\nsection 1306-a of the Real Property Tax Law by adding a new section\n(b) which provides that STAR tax savings shall be calculated to\ninclude any sales tax revenue shared by a county with a school\ndistrict.\nAny such sales tax revenue shall be added to each residential tax\nparcel eligible for STAR exemption in its pro rata percentage as an\nadditional tax levy, prior to calculating the STAR tax savings. The\nfirst sentence of existing subdivision 2 is lettered as (a) and the\nsecond sentence in existing subdivision 2 is lettered as (c).\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThere are currently five counties that\nshare sales tax\nrevenues with their school districts. In effect, each resident is\npaying part of his or her school taxes through sales taxes. Current\nSTAR law considers only the school taxes paid on the real property\ntax bill in calculating the STAR rebate, unfairly reducing the STAR\nand Senior STAR rebates to residents in these counties. This bill\nwould add the sales taxes paid to school districts into the amount\nused to calculate the STAR savings.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010 - S.2641/A.4844 -- LOCAL GOV'T/Real Propeliy\n2008 - S.2333-A/A.6485-A -- FINANCE/Real Property Taxation\n2007 - S.2333/A.6485 -- FINANCE/Real Property Taxation\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately and apply to\nreal propel1y taxes levied for fiscal years commencing on or after\nJanuary 1, 2012.\n\n",
