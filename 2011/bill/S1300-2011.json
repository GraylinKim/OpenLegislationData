  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1300\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the public housing law, in relation to the definition of\n\"family member\"\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThis bill amends Paragraph (c) of subdivision 4 of section 14 of the\npublic housing law to include uncles, aunts, nephews and nieces to\nthe definition of \"family member\" for the purposes of tenant\nsuccession of rent protected housing.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nCurrently the law defines \"family member\" as a husband, wife, son,\ndaughter, stepson, stepdaughter, father, mother, stepfather,\nstepmother, brother, sister, grandfather, grandmother, grandson,\ngranddaughter, daughter-in-law, son-in-law, mother-in-law or\nfather-in-law of the tenant; or any other person residing with the\ntenant in the housing accommodation as a primary residence who can\nprove emotional and financial commitment, and interdependence between\nsuch person and the tenant.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe traditional definition of \"family\" often does not reflect the\ndynamics and makeup of a modern family. It is common for nieces\nand/or nephews to live with aunts and/or uncles. However, these\nfamilies run into problems when it comes to tenant succession rights\nsince they are not included in the \"family member\" definition.\n\nThe current law does provide for \"any other person residing with the\ntenant in the housing accommodation as a primary residence who can\nprove emotional and financial commitment, and interdependence between\nsuch person and the tenant\". However, unlike the others listed in the\n\"family member\" definition these people have the added hurdle of\nproving the emotional, financial and interdependence to the tenant.\n\nThis extra hurdle nieces, nephews, aunts and uncles face is costly and\nburdensome. It is only right that these persons be included in the\n\"family member\" definition.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n1999-2000: S.6163 Died in Senate Housing, Construction & Community\nDevelopment Committee.\n2001-2002: S.4476 Died in Senate Housing, Construction & Community\nDevelopment Committee.\n2003-2004: S.2083 Died in Senate Housing, Construction & Community\nDevelopment\n2005-2006: S.2574 Died in Senate Housing, Construction& Community\nDevelopment\n2007-2008: S.2737 Died in Senate Housing, Construction & Community\n\nDevelopment\n2009:      S.1346 (Duane), Died in Senate Development;\nA.2107 (Benjamin), Died in Housing\n2010:      S.1346 (Duane), Died in Senate Development; A.2107\n(Benjamin), Died in Housing\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone or negligible to the State.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the first day of January next succeeding\nthe date on which it shall become law.\n\n",
