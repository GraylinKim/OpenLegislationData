  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2650\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the environmental conservation law, in relation to management of\nwildlife resources\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo amend several sections of the Environmental Conservation\nLaw (ECL) to simplify, clarify and eliminate inconsistencies relating\nto management of pheasants and quails.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThis legislation would allow the\nDepartment to set the open season and bag limits for the taking of\npheasants and quails on Long Island annually by regulation, as it\ncurrently does for those species in the rest of the State. Under\ncurrent law the open season and bag limits for pheasants and quail on\nLong Island are set in statute. In addition, this legislation\neliminates the need to obtain an immediate release permit for the\nliberation of ring-neck pheasants between August 16 and April 15.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nSeason bag limits for pheasant and quail are still\nspecified for certain portions of the State. This law is difficult to\nenforce and not needed given the widespread understanding and\nsatisfaction with statewide daily bag limits.\n\nAt the present time, an immediate release permit is required to\npurchase and release ring-neck pheasants without holding them in\ncaptivity. This is a common activity for many individuals and clubs\nand the permit serves no value except to create an additional,\nunneeded step in the process for legitimate sportsmen. It is often a\nlow priority for the ECOs to issue this permit and at times can\nresult in needless delay. The August 16 to April 15 period provided\nin this bill is consistent with the period in which dogs may be taken\nafield for training on wild game.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nPassed Senate every year from 2000-2008.\nS.842 of 2009/10 Referred to Environmental Conservation\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis bill shall take effect on the first of January\nnext succeeding the date on which it shall have become a law.\n\n",
