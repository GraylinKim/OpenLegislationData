Legislative findings.  The legislature finds that, as part\n    2  of the state's commitment to protecting the public health, it is  impor-\n    3  tant  to ensure the health and safety of both barbers and their clients.\n    4  The legislature also finds that the safe use and sterilization of  sharp\n    5  instruments  and  knowledge  of  the proper techniques to prevent trans-\n    6  mission of infection and disease are significant public health concerns.\n    7    The legislature further finds that, because most  barbers  choose  the\n    8  option  of entering the trade by apprenticing to a master barber, rather\n    9  than attending an accredited barber school, there  are  many  practicing\n   10  barbers  who have had no formal training and education in the health and\n   11  safety aspects of their trade. In addition, there is no requirement that\n   12  barbers complete periodic refresher courses in  the  health  and  safety\n   13  aspects of barbering.\n   14    S  2.  The secretary of state, in cooperation with the commissioner of\n   15  health and the commissioner of education, or their designees, and repre-\n   16  sentatives of the licensed barbering industry and barber educators shall\n   17  conduct a thorough evaluation of the need for educating barbers  on  the\n   18  health  and  safety aspects of their trade. The secretary of state shall\n   19  report the findings of this evaluation to the governor  and  legislature\n   20  no  later than April 1, 2012, including, but not limited to, recommenda-\n   21  tions on course content and the required number of hours  and  frequency\n   22  for  taking  a course, if it is determined that such education is neces-\n   23  sary in order to safeguard public health.\n   24    S 3.
