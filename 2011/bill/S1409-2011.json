  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1409\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the real property law, in relation to clarifying information\ncollected on a real property transfer form\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis legislation would change the Real Property Law to make\navailable necessary information including names and addresses of\nmembers of limited liability corporations to local municipalities to\nassist them in their efforts to enforce codes, properly administer\nthe assessment process and collect judgments and taxes.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 amends subparagraph 7 and 8 of subparagraph ii of\nsubdivision 1-e of section 333 of the real property law, as amended\nby section 1 of part B of Chapter 57 of the laws of\n2004 and adds two new subparagraphs 9 and 10 to require that a\npurchaser of a parcel, in the event it is a limited liability\ncompany, corporation or other such entity, must include the name of a\ncompany, the place of business of the company, the name of a\nresponsible party who has an interest in the company, and a telephone\nnumber where such responsible party may be contacted.\n\nSuch requirements would apply to all counties in New York State,\nincluding those comprising New York City.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nExisting law does not require that\nmember(s) of a LLC\nexecute articles of organization, specify actual place of business,\nor that the members of such LLC be listed.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nResidential properties are routinely acquired by\nLimited Liability Companies (LLCs) and often the buyer's signature on\nthe real property transfer form (RP-5217) is illegible, with a post\noffice box provided for the address. Current law does not require\nthat members of a LLC or the LLC's actual place of business be listed\non such forms.\n\nAs a result of these oversights in the current Real Property law,\nserious problems frequently arise for municipal code enforcement and\nassessment officials in carrying out the enforcement of the housing\ncode, collection of fines and judgments, and delinquent tax\ncollection. This inability to contact or provide legal service of\nnotices to an individual responsible for the property seriously\naffects the quality of life in neighborhoods with multiple properties\nowned by LLC's.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-2010 (S.5062) Referred to Judiciary\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect 180 days after it shall have become law.\n\n",
