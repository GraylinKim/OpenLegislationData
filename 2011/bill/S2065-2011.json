  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2065\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the tax law, in relation to certain tax credits for\nemployers\nwho encourage teleworking and certain amounts paid for certain\nreimbursements for\ntransportation; to amend the administrative code of the city of New\nYork, in relation to\nteleworking programs and authorizing the establishment of high\noccupancy vehicle in\nexpress routes parking lots and lanes; to amend the vehicle and\ntraffic law, in relation to\nimposing owner liability for failure of operator to comply with\nexpress bus\nlane restrictions;\nto amend the public authorities law and chapter 774 of the laws of\n1950, relating to agreeing with the state of New Jersey with\nrespect to rules and regulations governing traffic on vehicular\ncrossings operated by the port of New York authority, in relation to car\npool only electronic toll collection system lanes; to amend the\ntransportation law, in relation to creating a statewide telecommuting\nsupport program\nand authorizing the establishment of high occupancy vehicle in express\nroutes and lanes;\ncreating a temporary\nstate commission to study and investigate traffic congestion in the city\nof New York;\nand making an\nappropriation therefor\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF THE BILL:\nThis bill\nproposes a set of\nincentives to encourage New Yorkers to reduce congestion in Manhattan:\n(1) by increasing telecommuting; (2) by increasing car pooling; (3) by\nshifting commercial traffic to non-rush hours; and (4) by massively\nexpanding express bus service in the outer boroughs. The bill also\nempowers traffic enforcement agents to issue summonses for \"blocking\nthe box,\" a prime cause of gridlock in Manhattan, and creates a\ntwenty-member commission to study traffic congestion in New York City\nwithout any preconceived agenda pushing congestion pricing to the\nexclusion of other approaches.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThe bill amends the\nTax Law by adding\na new sections 29,30, 187-0, 187-p, 210(41), 210(42), 606(qq),\n606(rr), 1310(g), 1310(h), 1456(u), 1456(v), 1511(y) and 1511(z), and\namends Tax Law section 606(i) (1) (B), to provide employers tax\n\ncredits for establishing and maintaining telecommuting programs and\nfor providing financial incentives to employees to use public or\nalternative transportation; adds new Tax Law section 606(ss) to\nprovide certain tax credits to individuals who car pool; adds new Tax\nLaw section 606(tt) to provide certain tax credits to businesses\nwhich make non-rush hour deliveries; adds new Tax Law sections\n1201-a(d) and 1201-a(e) to authorize New York City to offer similar\ntax credits to employers to establish and maintain telecommuting and\nencourage employees to use public or alternative transportation;\namends the New York City Administrative Code (NYCAC) by adding\nsection 12-140 to require New York City agencies to establish\ntelecommuting programs; adds new NYCAC section 19-180 and state\nTransportation Law section 23 to require the New York City and New\nYork State\nDepartments of Transportation, respectively, to establish high\noccupancy vehicle (car pool) lanes on roadways leading into\nManhattan, where practicable; adds new Vehicle and Traffic Law\nsection 236(2-a) to make \"blocking the box\" a parking violation and\ntherefore subject to enforcement by a traffic agent; adds new Vehicle\nand Traffic Law section 1111-b authorize New York City to establish\ncamera-enforced bus rapid transit lanes; adds new Public Authorities\nLaw section 1265-b and new section 16-d to Chapter 774 of the laws of\n1950 to require the placement of car pool only and EZ-Pass booths and\ntolled roadways into Manhattan for use during certain hours; adds new\nTransportation Law section 14(3 I-a) to establish a statewide\ntelecommuting assistance program for employers;\nestablishes a state commission to study congestion in New York City;\nand appropriates $500 million from the local assistance account of\nthe general fund to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to\nincrease and expand express bus service into Manhattan.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nCongestion is a genuine problem in New\nYork City,\nrequiring thoughtful solutions which don't unnecessarily tax New\nYorkers. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's approach to\ncongestion reduction is all stick and no carrot; all punishment and\nno incentive.\nInstead of threatening to beat New Yorkers over the head with a $2,000\na year stick if they drive into Manhattan, this bill proposes a set\nof incentives 8 carrots 8 to encourage New Yorkers to reduce\ncongestion in Manhattan during rush hours, and gives New York City,\nNew York State and the relevant public authorities the tools\nnecessary to improve the flow of traffic into Manhattan.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nCurrently being determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n120 days after enactment, with provisions.\n\n",
