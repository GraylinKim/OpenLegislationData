LIFTON, GLICK, O'DONNELL, GOTTFRIED, M. MILLER,\n         MILLMAN, SCHIMEL, CASTRO, COLTON -- Multi-Sponsored by  --  M.  of  A.\n         COOK,  MARKEY,  PHEFFER,  WEISENBERG  -- read once and referred to the\n         Committee on Environmental Conservation\n\n       AN ACT to amend the environmental conservation law, in relation  to  the\n         natural gas exploration and extraction liability act of 2011\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as\n    2  the natural gas exploration and extraction liability act of 2011.\n    3    S  2.  Legislative findings. 1. The legislature finds that the process\n    4  used to stimulate natural gas extraction  referred  to  as  high  volume\n    5  hydraulic  fracturing,  also known as \"hydro fracturing\" and \"fracking,\"\n    6  utilizes components that are often toxic,  that  are  non-biodegradable,\n    7  and  that are virtually impossible to remove once they enter the natural\n    8  environment. Among the chemicals used  are  volatile  organic  compounds\n    9  such  as benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene. Many of the chemi-\n   10  cals used in this process are federally listed hazardous substances, and\n   11  there is only minimal data about the rest. Many of these hazardous chem-\n   12  icals are known carcinogens and others can cause other life  threatening\n   13  illnesses.  As  a  result  of the air and water pollution caused by such\n   14  exploration and extraction operations people are  exposed  to  endocrine\n   15  disrupting  agents that can cause kidney, liver, heart, blood, and brain\n   16  damage.\n   17    2. High volume hydraulic fracturing requires the construction of large\n   18  well pads (up to five acres) to  support  the  large  number  of  trucks\n   19  delivering  the  fracking chemicals, water trucks, pump trucks and other\n   20  equipment. Such  massive  scale  industrial  activity  causes  excessive\n   21  noise,  disturbs  underground  water  formations,  vibrates  surrounding\n   22  structures, and can result in earthquakes. Millions of gallons  of  this\n   23  chemically-laced  water  returns  to  the surface laden with salt, heavy\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD03870-01-1\n\n       A. 2108                             2\n\n    1  metals and radioactive elements. This wastewater is often stored in open\n    2  pits until transported for ultimate disposal. Wildlife and farm  animals\n    3  that  have  mistaken  these  pits for freshwater ponds have been killed.\n    4  Chemicals  may evaporate from these pits, contributing to air pollution.\n    5  Leaks and spills of fracking chemicals from the trucks  and  waste  pits\n    6  cause  contamination  of  surface  waters. The remainder of the fracking\n    7  fluid remains underground with the possibility of migrating  or  seeping\n    8  through fractures in the underground formations, cracks in the well-bore\n    9  casing, and through abandoned wells to pollute groundwater.\n   10    3.  Widespread  use  of high volume hydraulic fracturing diminishes or\n   11  destroys the natural beauty of the land, depletes or interferes with the\n   12  natural sources of water used for domestic  and  agricultural  purposes,\n   13  disrupts  the natural habitat of wildlife, imposes unaffordable costs on\n   14  municipalities and reduces property values thereby harming both homeown-\n   15  ers and the municipalities in which such activities are located.\n   16    4. Tourism is a major industry for much of the Marcellus  Shale  area.\n   17  The  construction  and  operation of natural gas wells in such area will\n   18  have a long term negative effect upon such industry that will result  in\n   19  lost profits and diminished business value and lost revenue to the muni-\n   20  cipalities where such tourism ventures are located.\n   21    5.  The  natural  gas  industry  has  embarked upon the procurement in\n   22  unprecedented numbers of mineral leases from private landowners across a\n   23  broad section of New York state  that  overlays  the  \"Marcellus  Shale\"\n   24  geological  structure for the purpose of utilizing high volume hydraulic\n   25  fracturing to extract and mine natural gas from the  shale.  It  is  not\n   26  unusual  for 40% or more of the land in such areas to be currently under\n   27  lease (although such land is owned by a small minority of landowners  in\n   28  the  region) and, accordingly, the industry is poised to secure billions\n   29  of dollars in profits from such extraction while potentially causing  an\n   30  even  greater  amount  of  damage  to  non-participating land owners and\n   31  renters, as well as to municipalities and even visitors to the area.\n   32    6. The legislature further finds that the use of high volume hydraulic\n   33  fracturing techniques constitutes a hazardous practice that will  result\n   34  in large scale damages to innocent parties.\n   35    7.  The  legislature  further finds that landowners who, subsequent to\n   36  the effective date of this act, enter into or extend leases with natural\n   37  gas exploration, operation, transportation or extraction entities  share\n   38  responsibility  with such entities for all damages shown to be caused by\n   39  such activities and that all responsible parties be held strictly liable\n   40  for damages resulting from such activities.\n   41    S 3. Article 23 of the environmental conservation law  is  amended  by\n   42  adding a new title 29 to read as follows:\n   43                                   TITLE 29\n   44              NATURAL GAS EXPORTATION AND EXTRACTION LIABILITY\n   45  SECTION 23-2901.
