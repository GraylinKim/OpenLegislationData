  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1259\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the civil rights law, in relation to electronic monitoring\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nTo require employers engaged in monitoring or intercepting electronic\ncommunications of any employee by any electronic device or system to\nprovide notice of such monitoring.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThis bill amends the civil rights law by adding a new section 52{a}.\n\nSubdivision 1 defines for the purposes of the section the term\n\"employer\", which shall not include the state or any political\nsubdivision of the state.\n\nSubdivision 2 requires private employers engaging in electronic\nmonitoring, which includes monitoring or otherwise intercepting\ntelephone conversations or transmissions, electronic mail or\ntransmission, or internet usage of or by the employee, by any\nelectronic device or system, to give prior notice to employees in\nwriting, in an electronic record, or in another electronic form. The\nnotice must be acknowledged by the employee either in writing or\nelectronically. Employers are also required to post the notice in a\nnoticeable place which is readily accessible to employees.\n\nIn addition, employees shall be advised that any and all telephone\nconversations or transmissions, electronic mail or transmissions, or\ninternet access or usage of by an employee by any electronic device\nor system may be subject to monitoring at any and all times and by\nany lawful means.\n\nSubdivision 3 authorizes the attorney general to enforce the\nprovisions of the section. Any employer in violation of this section\nshall be subject to a maximum civil penalty of five hundred dollars\nfor the first offense, one thousand dollars for the second offense\nand three thousand dollars for the third and each subsequent offense.\n\nSubdivision 4 does not apply to processes undertaken by employers to\nmanage the type or volume of incoming or outgoing electronic mail or\ntelephone voice mail or internet usage for the purpose of computer\nsystem maintenance and/or protection.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nA report from American Management Agency's 2007 surveillance survey\ndetermined employers fired employees for internet misuse based upon\ncited violation of company policy and excessive personal use. In\naddition, a Harris poll determined forty percent of five-hundred plus\nemployees to be unaware of their employers' monitoring policy.\n\nEmployers also have the availability of computer software that can\nscreen and store an employee's computer terminal and bard disk,\nmonitor internet usage such as web-surfing and electronic mail, and\nmonitor idle time or away time from an employee's computer terminal\nwithout employee recognition. All these measures presume an employee\nis at a disadvantage in recognizing and understanding an employers'\nmonitoring policy.\n\nBy requiring employer notification of monitoring or intercepting of\ninformation at any and all times through lawful means ensures\nemployee privacy and an understanding of consequences resulting from\ninappropriate internet activity. Requiring prior written notice of\nelectronic monitoring benefits employers as employees will be less\nlikely to undermine company standards. Further, companies will retain\nthe right to monitor computer usage, simply with the stipulation that\nemployees are informed of surveillance practices. This knowledge will\nincrease transparency within the organization and help to avoid\nlawsuits and litigation regarding invasion of privacy.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-2010: S.4755 - Passed Codes. Advanced to 3rd Reading Calendar.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone. The bill only apply to those employers who have prior electronic\nmonitoring practices.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nShall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after it becomes law.\n\n",
