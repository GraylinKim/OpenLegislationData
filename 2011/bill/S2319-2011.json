The new\nsection will provide that the bonding activities of public authorities\nand public benefit corporations would be restricted in order that no\nbond or note may be issued for a purpose with a probable life shorter\nthan the contract life of the bond or note.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThe State constitution forbids the State from issuing bonds for purposes\nwith an expected life shorter than the contract life of the bond itself.\nThe purpose of this constitutional provision is to prevent the State\nfrom bonding out its operations costs. This bill would extend the same\nprincipal of fiscal soundness to all public authorities and public bene-\nfit corporations created by or pursuant to New York State law.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNo cost to the State.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall have\nbecome a law.\n\n",
