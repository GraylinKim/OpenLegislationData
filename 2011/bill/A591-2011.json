This section does not diminish the enforceability of a contract or\n   35  agreement  in  which a person controlling the disposition of the remains\n   36  of a decedent agrees to pay for goods or services in connection with the\n   37  disposition of such remains.\n   38    S 2. This act shall take effect immediately.\n",
