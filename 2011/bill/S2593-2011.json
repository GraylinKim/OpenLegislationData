The  court  shall  on  such form obtain the address where the sex\n   15  offender expects to reside upon his or her release,  and  the  name  and\n   16  address  of  any institution of higher education he or she expects to be\n   17  employed by, enrolled in, attending or  employed,  whether  for  compen-\n   18  sation  or  not,  and  whether he or she expects to reside in a facility\n   19  owned or operated by such an institution, AND, IF APPLICABLE, A COPY  OF\n   20  THE ORDER ISSUED, AND DESCRIPTION OF ALL PROCEEDINGS THAT HAVE OCCURRED,\n   21  PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY OF THE CRIMI-\n   22  NAL PROCEDURE LAW and shall report such information to the division.

This  notice  shall  include  the  following  statement or a\n   30  substantially similar statement:  \"This  proceeding  is  being  held  to\n   31  determine  whether you will be classified as a level 3 offender (risk of\n   32  repeat offense is high), a level 2 offender (risk of repeat  offense  is\n   33  moderate),  or  a  level  1 offender (risk of repeat offense is low), or\n   34  whether you will be designated as a sexual predator, a sexually  violent\n   35  offender  or a predicate sex offender, which will determine how long you\n   36  must register as a sex offender and how much information can be provided\n   37  to the public concerning your registration. If you  fail  to  appear  at\n   38  this  proceeding,  without  sufficient  excuse, it shall be held in your\n   39  absence. Failure to appear may result in a longer period of registration\n   40  or a higher level of community notification because you are not  present\n   41  to offer evidence or contest evidence offered by the district attorney.\"\n   42  The  court shall also advise the sex offender that he or she has a right\n   43  to a hearing prior to the court's determination, that he or she has  the\n   44  right  to be represented by counsel at the hearing and that counsel will\n   45  be appointed if he or she is financially unable to  retain  counsel.  If\n   46  the  sex  offender applies for assignment of counsel to represent him or\n   47  her at the hearing and counsel was not previously assigned to  represent\n   48  the  sex  offender  in  the  underlying criminal action, the court shall\n   49  determine whether the offender is financially unable to retain  counsel.\n   50  If  such  a finding is made, the court shall assign counsel to represent\n   51  the sex offender pursuant to article eighteen-B of the county law. Where\n   52  the court orders a sex offender released on probation, such  order  must\n   53  include  a  provision  requiring that he or she comply with the require-\n   54  ments of this article. Where such sex offender violates such  provision,\n   55  probation  may  be immediately revoked in the manner provided by article\n   56  four hundred ten of the criminal procedure law.\n\n       S. 2593                             5\n\n    1    3. For sex offenders released on probation or discharged upon  payment\n    2  of a fine, conditional discharge or unconditional discharge, OR RELEASED\n    3  OR DISCHARGED PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY\n    4  OF  THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW, it shall be the duty of the court apply-\n    5  ing  the  guidelines  established  in  subdivision  five  of section one\n    6  hundred sixty-eight-l of this article to determine the level of  notifi-\n    7  cation  pursuant to subdivision six of section one hundred sixty-eight-l\n    8  of this article and whether such sex  offender  shall  be  designated  a\n    9  sexual predator, sexually violent offender, or predicate sex offender as\n   10  defined  in  subdivision  seven  of section one hundred sixty-eight-a of\n   11  this article. At least fifteen days prior to the determination  proceed-\n   12  ing, the district attorney shall provide to the court and the sex offen-\n   13  der  a  written statement setting forth the determinations sought by the\n   14  district attorney together with the reasons for  seeking  such  determi-\n   15  nations.  The court shall allow the sex offender to appear and be heard.\n   16  The state shall appear by the district attorney, or his or her designee,\n   17  who shall bear the burden of proving the facts supporting  the  determi-\n   18  nations  sought  by  clear  and  convincing evidence.   Where there is a\n   19  dispute between the parties concerning  the  determinations,  the  court\n   20  shall adjourn the hearing as necessary to permit the sex offender or the\n   21  district  attorney  to  obtain  materials relevant to the determinations\n   22  from any state or local facility, hospital, institution, office, agency,\n   23  department or division. Such materials may be obtained  by  subpoena  if\n   24  not voluntarily provided to the requesting party. In making the determi-\n   25  nations,  the court shall review any victim's statement and any relevant\n   26  materials and evidence submitted by the sex offender  and  the  district\n   27  attorney  and the court may consider reliable hearsay evidence submitted\n   28  by either party provided that it  is  relevant  to  the  determinations.\n   29  Facts  previously  proven at trial or elicited at the time of entry of a\n   30  plea of guilty OR PREVIOUSLY ELICITED AT THE TIME  A  PLEA  IS  ENTERED,\n   31  WHICH IS ACCEPTED BY THE COURT, OR ARE PROVEN AT A TRIAL WHERE A VERDICT\n   32  HAS  BEEN  ENTERED,  OF  NOT  RESPONSIBLE BY REASON OF MENTAL DISEASE OR\n   33  DEFECT shall be deemed established by clear and convincing evidence  and\n   34  shall  not be relitigated. The court shall render an order setting forth\n   35  its determinations and the findings of fact and conclusions  of  law  on\n   36  which the determinations are based. A copy of the order shall be submit-\n   37  ted  by the court to the division. Upon application of either party, the\n   38  court shall seal any portion of the court file or record which  contains\n   39  material that is confidential under any state or federal statute. Either\n   40  party  may  appeal as of right from the order pursuant to the provisions\n   41  of articles fifty-five, fifty-six and fifty-seven of the civil  practice\n   42  law  and  rules.  Where  counsel  has been assigned to represent the sex\n   43  offender upon the ground that the sex offender is financially unable  to\n   44  retain  counsel,  that  assignment  shall  be  continued  throughout the\n   45  pendency of the appeal, and the person  may  appeal  as  a  poor  person\n   46  pursuant to article eighteen-B of the county law.\n   47    4. If a sex offender, having been given notice, including the time and\n   48  place  of  the determination proceeding in accordance with this section,\n   49  fails to appear at this proceeding, without sufficient excuse, the court\n   50  shall conduct the hearing and make the determinations in the manner  set\n   51  forth in subdivision three of this section.\n   52    S  5.  Section  29.16 of the mental hygiene law, as amended by chapter\n   53  465 of the laws of 1992, is amended to read as follows:\n   54  S 29.16 Discharge OR RELEASE; certain cases.\n   55    (A) The director of a facility shall,  with  respect  to  any  patient\n   56  admitted  to  such facility pursuant to section five hundred nine of the\n\n       S. 2593                             6\n\n    1  executive law or 353.4 of the family  court  act  and  article  nine  or\n    2  fifteen  of this chapter, give immediate written notice to the [director\n    3  of the division for youth] OFFICE OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES and to\n    4  the mental hygiene legal service when any such patient leaves the facil-\n    5  ity  without  the  consent  of  its  director.
