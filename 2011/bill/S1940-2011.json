  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1940\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the education law, in relation to the unlawful sale of\ndissertations, theses and term papers\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo extend the current prohibition against the sale of dissertations\nand term papers to papers provided through electronic media such as\nthe Internet.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nAmends Section 213b of the Education Law to add the phrase \"either\nwritten or provided through electronic media\" to prohibition against\nthe sale or purchase of dissertations, theses, term papers, essays,\nreports or other educational assignments.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nExtends the prohibition against the sale or purchase of term papers\nand these to documents provided for sale or purchase through\nelectronic media such as the Internet. Students would still be able\nto access research information through this media but sale or\npurchase of a term paper, theses or dissertation would constitute a\nviolation punishable, as in current law, by a fine of up to $1,000.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nCurrent new York State law bans the sale or purchase of dissertations\nand term papers but does not specifically indicate that papers\nobtained over the Internet or other electronic media would also be\ncovered under the ban. This legislation would remove this ambiguity\nand would assure that students or others providing such unlawful\nassistance would eligible for prosecution.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n1998 S.6358; 1999-00 S.1971; 2002 S.2353; 2003-04 S.298; 2005-06\nS.1148; 2007-08 S.1527; 2009 S.2730\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
