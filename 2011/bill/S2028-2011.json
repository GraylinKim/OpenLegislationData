  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2028\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the real property law, in relation to real property\nappraisals in certain cases\n\nSUMMARY:\nThis bill would amend Real Property Law &sect;254-C(1) to require that a\ncopy of any real estate appraisal required by a lender as part of a\nmortgage application be available to the applicant at the closing, if\nrequested in writing at least ten days prior to the closing.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nIn 1983, the Legislature enacted Section 254-c of the Real Property\nLaw to give residential mortgage applicants the right to a copy of\nany real estate appraisal of the property involved. Under this law,\napplicants are entitled to a copy of the real estate appraisal\nprovided that: 1) the lender mandates an appraisal as part of the\nmortgage application process, 2) the applicant is required to pay for\nthe appraisal and 3) the applicant requests a copy of the appraisal\nin writing.\n\nChapter 245 of the Laws of 1983 was enacted in response to the failure\nof many lending institutions to provide borrowers with copies of real\nestate appraisals, even though the lender required them and required\nthe borrower to bear the cost of securing these appraisals. By giving\nsuch borrowers a right to a copy of the appraisal Chapter 245 sought\nto correct this situation.\n\nUnfortunately, the new law failed to specify a time period for\ncompliance. Although written requests for copies of real estate\nappraisals may have been made prior to the closing, the appraisal\nitself need not be made available at the closing.\n\nThis situation is further compounded by the fact that many major\nlenders may take the mortgage application in one branch office,\nprocess the application in another part of the State and eventually\nstore all the mortgage materials in yet another part of the State.\nThis makes securing a copy of the appraisal very difficult for some\nborrowers.\n\nThis bill would remedy this situation by requiring lenders to have a\ncopy of the appraisal at the closing, provided that the borrower\nmakes a written request at least ten days prior to the closing.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis act shall take effect on the one hundred twentieth day after it\nshall have become a law.\n\n",
