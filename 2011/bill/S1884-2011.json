  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1884\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to the crime of bias-related\ngraffiti\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nThis bill amends Section 240.31 of the Penal Law by adding a new\nsubdivision, 1-a. This subdivision adds the language \"etches, paints,\ncovers, draws upon or otherwise places a mark upon public or private\nproperty\" to the crime of aggravated harassment in the first degree.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThis bill proposes enhanced penalties for bias-related graffiti in\nrecognition of the particularly sensitive nature of such graffiti.\nGraffiti that is based upon hate should receive a tighter penalty.\nEnhancing the penalty will serve to reinforce the seriousness of this\ncrime and prove to offenders that New York State does not tolerate\nbias in any form.\n\nCurrently, graffiti is treated as a Class A misdemeanor in Section\n145.60 of the Penal Law. This legislation would include bias-related\ngraffiti under the section of Penal Law that currently covers\ndesecration of religious property. Under this bill, bias-related\ngraffiti would be considered a Class E felony. This would increase\nthe allowable penalty for bias-related graffiti from up to a year in\njail under a Class A misdemeanor to a range of 1 1/3 to 4 years for a\nClass E felony at the discretion of the judge.\n\nRecent incidents of bias-related graffiti in Westchester County\nexemplify the need to give prosecutors greater leverage in\nprosecuting such offenders.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n03/16/09 REFERRED TO CODES\n01/06/10 REFERRED TO CODES\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the first of November next succeeding\nthe date on which it shall have become a law.\n\n",
