  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2033\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto provide continued tenancy for certain non-purchasing senior\ncitizens in the city of New York\n\nPURPOSE/SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nTo provide that any citizen, age 62 or\nolder, who has maintained a continued occupancy and is a\nnon-purchasing tenant in a multiple dwelling unit which has been\nconverted to a coop or condominium, pursuant to an eviction plan,\nwill not be subject to an eviction.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nOver the past decade, the legislature has enacted into\nlaw protections to ensure that senior citizens should not be subject\nto eviction under co-op and condominium conversion plans. Despite\nthese attempts to provide a blanket protection, there are still\nsenior citizens who continue to reside in multiple dwelling units who\nare not afforded these protections.\n\nWith the vacancy rate in NYC remaining under five percent, and\ntherefore housing being scarce, it is incumbent upon the legislature\nto insure that senior citizens be afforded protections against\neviction plans, as long as they meet certain requirements:\n\n1. be 62 years of age or older;\n\n2. has maintained a continued occupancy;\n\n3. and is a non-purchasing tenant in a multiple dwelling unit which\nhas been converted to a co-op or condominium, pursuant to an eviction\nplan.\nThis bill provides the necessary protection.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nNone.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to the state.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
