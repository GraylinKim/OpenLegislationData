  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1288\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the banking law, in relation to making ATMs accessible to the\nvisually impaired\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\n\nTo require ATMs to use both audio and visual systems of relaying\nmessages to its customers thus providing equal access for all\nindividuals.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\n\nThe banking law is amended by adding a new article 2-D to require\nthat: 1. Any automated teller machine installed on or after the\neffective date of this article shall transmit any message through\nboth (a) a visual transmission system, and (b) an audio transmission\nsystem. 2. Any automated teller machine installed prior to the\neffective date of this article shall, whenever an upgrade or\nreplacement of such automated teller machine becomes necessary, be\nupgraded or replaced in such a manner so that such automated teller\nmachine shall transmit any message through both (a) a visual\ntransmission system, and (b) an audio transmission system.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nAs technology increases, more and more people rely on automated teller\nmachines (ATMs) as a method for doing daily banking tasks. While many\nATMs currently have Braille labels indicating the functions of some\nbuttons, most machines do not have any non-visual method for reading\nor relaying the sequence of messages that appear on the screen. All\nindividuals should have an equal opportunity to access these machines.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n2006: S.7127 (Duane), Died in Banking\n2007: S.2314 (Duane), Died in Banking\n2008: S.2314 (Duane), Died in Banking\n2009: S.1519 (Duane), Died in Banking\n2010: S.1519 (Duane), Died in Banking\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nNone to the State.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThis act shall take effect 120 days after it shall have become a law;\nprovided that the superintendent of banks is authorized to promulgate\nany and all rules and regulations and take any other measures\nnecessary to implement this act on its effective date on or before\nsuch date.\n\n",
