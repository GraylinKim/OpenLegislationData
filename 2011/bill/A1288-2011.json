GANTT -- read once and referred to the Committee\n         on Transportation\n\n       AN ACT to amend the transportation law, the  environmental  conservation\n         law, the vehicle and traffic law and the insurance law, in relation to\n         enacting the \"hazardous materials transport security act\"\n\n         THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-\n       BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n    1    Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the  \"hazardous\n    2  materials transport security act\".\n    3    S  2.  Legislative findings. Since the World Trade Center and Pentagon\n    4  attacks of September 11, 2001, it has  become  evident  that  terrorists\n    5  intend to attack the United States economy by any and every means avail-\n    6  able, including using hazardous materials vehicles as potential \"weapons\n    7  of  mass  destruction\".  Although  several laws, both at the federal and\n    8  state level, have been considered to enhance the security of  transport-\n    9  ing  these  hazardous  materials, much remains to be done, especially in\n   10  high-risk states such as New York. Basic best practices  security  regu-\n   11  lations  must be implemented for the transport of hazardous materials to\n   12  protect the citizens, economy, and environment of New York from  terror-\n   13  ist  attacks.  A  successful  attack  would severely damage the New York\n   14  economy and, in particular, threaten the viability of the  vital  indus-\n   15  tries  which now produce, transport, and consume the hazardous materials\n   16  that are essential inputs for a modern industrial economy.\n   17    The federal government has issued several warnings and  advisories  to\n   18  hazardous  materials transporters that such vehicles could be weaponized\n   19  by terrorists or other enemies of the United States.    There  currently\n   20  exist  many  devices  that  can  prevent the theft or hijacking of these\n   21  vehicles; other devices provide local law enforcement officials with the\n   22  tools to take  control  of  such  vehicles  if  a  hijacking  cannot  be\n   23  prevented.  This  act  establishes  a task force to review, examine, and\n\n        EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets\n                             [ ] is old law to be omitted.\n                                                                  LBD03371-01-1\n\n       A. 1288                             2\n\n    1  make recommendations  on  the  efficacy,  operational  feasibility,  and\n    2  economic  impacts of mandating such security devices across the New York\n    3  hazardous materials fleet.\n    4    This  act  mandates  that  authorized representatives of generators of\n    5  products considered to be hazardous materials  with  responsibility  for\n    6  loading those hazardous products and waste shall, prior to that loading,\n    7  ensure  that the driver of the transport vehicle be in possession of the\n    8  proper  commercial  driver's  license,  including  hazardous   materials\n    9  endorsements,  required  to  lawfully operate the transport vehicle with\n   10  its intended load.  This act also mandates that vehicles used to  trans-\n   11  port  hazardous materials and wastes be equipped with a two-way communi-\n   12  cation device that would allow immediate communication with a  New  York\n   13  state-authorized  emergency response center in the event of an emergency\n   14  involving hazardous materials.\n   15    S 3. Section 14-f of the transportation law is amended by adding a new\n   16  subdivision 7 to read as follows:\n   17    7.
