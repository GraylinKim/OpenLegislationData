  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1813\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the social services law, in relation to allowing local social\nservices districts discretion to provide certain medicaid services\nand to cover certain categories of eligibility\n\nPURPOSE OF THE BILL\nThis bill authorizes local Social Services Districts\nto choose which state-required but not federally-required Medicaid\nservices to provide and categories of eligibility to cover.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\n&sect; 1- Amends &sect; 365-a of the Social Services Law by adding a new\nsubdivision 8 to authorize each Local Social Services District to\ndetermine which, if any, state-required but not federally-required\nservices it will provide.\n\n&sect; 2- Amends &sect; 366 of the Social Services Law by adding a new\nsubdivision 10 to authorize each Local Social Services District to\ndetermine which, if any, state-required but not federally-required\ncategories of eligibility to cover.\n\n&sect; 3- Authorizes the Commissioner of Health to apply for all federal\nwaivers that are required to implement the provisions. In addition the\nCommissioner shall promulgate any and all rules and regulations\nnecessary to implement the provisions. Further, the Commissioner shall\nspecify dates by which such  services and eligibility plans must be\nreturned to the Commissioner for review and approval to implement the\nplans. A district that does not have an approved plan by the\ndeadline, shall provide all services and categories of eligibility\nrequired under the state plan that is in effect at that time.\n\n&sect; 4- Effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nCurrently there are federally-required and\nstate-required Medicaid services that each county of New York must\nprovide to its citizens. There is little doubt that both\nfederally-required and state-required Medicaid services and categories\nof eligibility have put a strain on county budgets.  In recent months\nCounty officials from all over the\nstate have suggested\nthat allowing each county to determine their own Medicaid program\nservices and categories of eligibility will enable them to tailor\nthe services they provide to the population they serve, thus allowing for\ncost savings.\nThis bill allows each county to tailor its Medicaid program to fit the\nneeds of its population by choosing which state-required services and\ncategories of eligibility to provide. If a county does not have an\napproved plan by the date specified by the Commissioner of Health,\nthe county will be required to provide the services and categories of\neligibility that arc required by state law at that time.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\n\n2005-2006: A.5464/3539\n2007 - S.3295/A.4677 -- HEALTH/Social Services\n2008 - S.3295-A/A.4677-A -- SOCIAL SERV/CHILD & FAM/Social Services\n2010 - S.2989/A.6777 -- HEALTH/Social Services\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nYet to be determined. Cost savings to both\ncounties and the State are expected.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
