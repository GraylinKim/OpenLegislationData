  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1382\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to\ncontracts with school bus companies; and to amend the\nenvironmental conservation law, in relation to eliminating the cap\non air pollution fees\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo require that buses transporting New York City's public\nschool children be retrofitted with either diesel particulate filters\nor diesel oxidation catalysts, whichever is appropriate. This bill\nalso eliminates the per-ton fee cap for facilities emitting regulated\nair contaminants.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection 1 of the bill would re-letter\nsubdivision g of section 19-606 of the administrative code of New\nYork City as subdivision h and add a new subdivision g that would\nrequire any school bus company providing services to students under\ncontract with the City Department of Education to install diesel\noxidation catalysts or diesel particulate filters and to use\nultra-low sulfur fuel. Installation of the diesel emissions devices\nwould be required within two years of the bill's effective date, or\nupon entering into or renewing a contract with the department,\nwhichever is later.\n\nSection 2 of the bill would amend subdivision 1 of Section 72-0303 of\nthe environmental conservation law to eliminate the per-ton fee cap\nfor facilities emitting regulated air contaminants.\n\nSection 3 of the bill sets forth the effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nThe harmful health effects of diesel exhaust have been studied and\ndocumented for decades, and an increasing number of health\nauthorities have recognized diesel exhaust as a potential carcinogen.\nDiesel exhaust is also known as a major source of fine particles,\nwhich can exacerbate asthma, a condition most prevalent among\nchildren and of epidemic proportions in many neighborhoods of New\nYork City. In addition, diesel engines emit smog-forming oxides of\nnitrogen in mass quantities, which have been linked to decreased lung\nfunction growth in children. According to a 2004 study by the\nAmerican Lung Association in metropolitan Chicago, schoolchildren on\na conventional diesel school bus are exposed to up to five times as\nmuch diesel emission as they would encounter on a retrofitted bus\nthat uses ultra-low-sulfur fuel.\n\nNew York City's more than 5,000 school buses, which are owned by over 50\nbus companies that have contracted with the City Department of\nEducation, run on diesel fuel. Over 300,000 New York City school\nchildren ride these buses every school day. In 2001, the New York\nPower Authority initiated a $6 million program to install pollution\ncontrol systems in city school buses, and has since retrofitted over\n1,500 to 2,000 school buses. The voluntary program pays to install\ndiesel particulate filters on newer buses and diesel oxidation\ncatalysts on older buses, reducing diesel bus emissions by more than\n90%. This legislation would make it mandatory for buses transporting\nNew York City's school children to have either retrofitted diesel\nparticulate filters or diesel oxidation catalysts.\n\nThis legislation would also eliminate the per-ton cap on air pollution\nfees, generating several million dollars per year in additional air\npollution fees collected. The fee on sources of regulated air\ncontaminants was established to finance the direct and indirect costs\nassociated with the Department of Environmental Conservation's\noperating permit program.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-10:  Referred to Cities\n\nIMPACT ON THE STATE:\nEliminating the per-ton cap on air pollution fees\nwould generate. additional revenue for the State.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis bill shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
