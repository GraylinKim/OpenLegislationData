ANY RETAIL MOTOR VEHICLE DEALER  WHO  NEGOTIATES\n    5  PRIMARILY IN A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH, ORALLY OR IN WRITING, IN THE\n    6  COURSE  OF  ENTERING  INTO  A CONTRACT FOR THE SALE OR LEASE OF A NEW OR\n    7  USED MOTOR VEHICLE, SHALL DELIVER TO THE CONSUMER WHO IS THE OTHER PARTY\n    8  TO SUCH CONTRACT AND  PRIOR  TO  THE  EXECUTION  OF  SUCH  CONTRACT,  AN\n    9  UNSIGNED  TRANSLATION  OF  SUCH  CONTRACT, IN THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH SUCH\n   10  CONTRACT WAS NEGOTIATED.\n   11    A. IN ADDITION TO THE PENALTIES IMPOSED UNDER THIS SUBCHAPTER, FAILURE\n   12  TO COMPLY  WITH  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  THIS  SECTION  SHALL  ENTITLE  THE\n   13  AGGRIEVED  CONSUMER  TO  CANCEL  SUCH CONTRACT. UPON A FAILURE TO COMPLY\n   14  WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION, THE AGGRIEVED CONSUMER  MAY  CANCEL\n   15  THE CONTRACT. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, CANCELLATION SHALL BE DEEMED\n   16  TO  HAVE  OCCURRED  WHEN  WRITTEN NOTICE OF CANCELLATION IS GIVEN TO THE\n   17  RETAIL DEALER. NOTICE OF CANCELLATION, IF MAILED, SHALL BE DEEMED DELIV-\n   18  ERED ON THE DATE OF THE POSTMARK.
