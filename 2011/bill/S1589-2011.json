  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1589\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the education law, in relation to defining \"tuition\" for the\n2012-2013 school year\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo provide that certain schools may maintain a fund balance reserve\naccount of up to 4% of the school's annual allowable and reimbursable\ncosts.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nSection one amends subdivision 4 of section 4405 of education law by\nadding a new paragraph j to provide that special act school districts\nand Chapter 853 schools, may maintain a fund balance of up to 4% of\nthe school's annual allowable and reimbursable costs.\n\nSection two of the bill sets forth the enactment date, which is\nimmediate.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nSpecial act school districts and 853 schools in New York State\nrepresent a particularly high needs student population. The high need\nlevel associated with this population results in significant costs to\noperate these schools. Under current law however, these schools and\nschool districts are not authorized to maintain any fund balance at\nthe end of their fiscal year.\nTherefore, even if these districts achieve efficiencies, they are left\nwith no funds to reinvest in their programs. Further, because the\nschools operated off of borrowed funds, repaid when they receive\ntheir tuition, their lack of resources can make it more difficult to\nacquire the financing they need to sustain their operations.\n\nFinally, special act school districts are public school districts.\nRecent changes in state law allow all other public school districts\nto maintain a 4% undesignated fund balance. It seems only equitable\nto offer the same level of flexibility to these schools and school\ndistricts.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.5446-A/A.8245-A of 2009 - Vetoed\nS.6775 of 201O.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone to the State.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
