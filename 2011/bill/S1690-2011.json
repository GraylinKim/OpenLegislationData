  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1690\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the labor law, in relation to establishing a presumption\nrelating to the daily employment of unskilled or untrained workers\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nCreates a rebuttable presumption in a criminal proceeding that an\nemployer who hires an unskilled or untrained worker or laborer on a\ndaily basis and such worker is required to perform tasks he or she\nis not skilled or trained to perform is criminally negligent.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nA new section 202-L is added to the labor law. In a criminal proceeding\nagainst an employer who hires unskilled or untrained workers to\nperform tasks such worker or laborer is not skilled or trained to\nperform this bill creates a rebuttable presumption that the\nemployer is guilty of criminal negligence. Section 202-L(2)\nEstablishes that the presumption created in section 202-L may be\nrebutted by credible and reliable evidence to show employer was not\nnegligent. This section also addresses jury instructions in these\ncases. Also establishes that the prosecution shall provide notice to\nthe defendant and the court of its intention to request that the\ncourt charge such presumption.\n\nEFFECTS OF PRESENT LAW WHICH THIS BILL WOULD ALTER:\nCurrently there is no presumption of negligence in cases involving\nemployers who hire unskilled labor.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nEach day in the City of New York and elsewhere, potential day-laborers\ngather on street corners hoping to be hired by one of the\ncontractors who cruise the streets looking for cheap labor. These\nworkers are unskilled and untrained. They are often called upon to\nperform dangerous jobs that require skill and experience. In August\n1999 Daniel Eduardo, an unskilled laborer, died on an unsafe\nconstruction site when he drowned in concrete after an improperly\nbraced floor collapsed. This accident would have resulted in many\nmore deaths if not for the heroic efforts of fire personnel and police\nwho literally swam through concrete\nto reach trapped workers. Mr. Eduardo is only one example of hundreds\nof unskilled day-laborers who toil on construction projects in this\nState. They are often illegal immigrants who are paid less than\nminimum wage. They are often exposed to dangerous conditions such as\nexposed wiring, asbestos and unsafe building practices. They will not\nreport safety violations because they are often illegal immigrants\nwho fear reprisal or deportation. New York State must ensure worker\nsafety and punish those who knowingly subject unskilled, untrained\nworkers to hazardous situations and practices. This legislation will\nensure that contractors who knowingly hire unskilled, untrained\n\nlaborers to do dangerous jobs will be held accountable for their\nactions.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.3115 of 2007\n02/23/08 Referred to Labor\nS.190 of 2009\n01/07/09\nREFERRED TO LABOR\n01/06/10 REFERRED TO LABOR\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the first of November next succeeding\nthe date on which it shall have become a law.\n\n",
