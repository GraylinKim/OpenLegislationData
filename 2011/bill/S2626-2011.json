  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2626\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the domestic relations law, in relation to grounds for an\naction for divorce\n\nSUMMARY:\nThis bill would add a new subdivision 7 to section 170 of the domestic\nrelations law. This bill would allow that an action for divorce may\nbe maintained by a husband or wife to procure a judgment divorcing\nthe parties and dissolving the parties and dissolving the marriage\nupon conviction and sentencing of a class A felony; and/or a class B\nor C violent felony as defined in section 70.02 of the penal law;\nand/or the final conviction of the defendant for a felony sex offense\nas defined in article one hundred thirty of the penal law.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nGrounds for divorce in New York are purely statutory. The grounds in\nwhich a divorce may be granted have not been expanded since 1966.\nUnder current law, a spouse may file for divorce on the ground of\nimprisonment, only after their spouse has been imprisoned for three\nyears. This provision would allow the non imprisoned spouse the\noption of filing for divorce upon the defendant spouse's conviction\nof the aforementioned felony offense(s).\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATION:\nNone to the State.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect on the thirtieth day after it shall have\nbecome a law.\n\n",
