  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S977                REVISED 01/10/2011\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the correction law, in relation to increasing\naccess to substance\nabuse programming for prisoners whose first language is not English\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\n\nThis bill would require the commissioner of corrections, in\nconsultation with the commissioner on Alcohol and substance Abuse\nServices, to take steps to ensure that prisoners whose first language\nis not English are able to access prison substance abuse programs.\nThe bill addresses the difficulty currently experienced by\nsignificant numbers of inmates in understanding, participating and\ncompleting prison substance abuse programs.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\n\nThe bill amends Article 22 of the correction Law by adding subsection\n624 requiring the commissioner of corrections, in consultation with\nthe commissioner on Alcohol and Substance Abuse services, to take\nsteps to ensure that prisoners whose first language is not English\nare able to access prison substance abuse programs. Such steps may\ninclude, but need not be limited to, increased employment of\nbilingual substance abuse counselors and program staff, translation\nof program content and materials, targeted programs for non-English\nspeaking prisoners, and other strategies determined by the\ncommissioner in consultation with the commissioner of alcohol and\nsubstance abuse services.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nTen percent of the state prison population, more than 6,000 inmates,\nwere born outside of the united states. Only twenty-eight (28)\npercent of those prisoners come from countries where the dominant\nlanguage is English, fifty-four (54) percent come from countries\nwhere the dominant language is Spanish, and eighteen (19) percent are\nfrom countries that speak primarily Asian, European or other\nlanguages. Twenty-five (25) percent of the state prison population,\nmore than 16,000 inmates, are of Hispanic origin. Hispanic inmates\nare housed throughout the system, but the highest concentrations of\nHispanic inmates are housed in the Sullivan hub (33 percent) and New\nYork city hub (31 percent.)\n\nThe department of correctional services has recognized that it is\nnecessary to expand its capacity to address the needs of prisoners\nwho may have difficulty speaking and understanding program content\npresented only in English. Substance abuse programs are of critical\n\nimportance to the prisoner and to the community, as research\nconsistently shows that prison treatment programs reduce recidivism\nand lower health care and social service costs upon re-entry to\nsociety. Studies also show that prison treatment programs have a\nsignificantly positive impact on inmate behavior, making our prisons\nsafer and more secure.\n\nThe Department of Correctional Services operates a variety of\nsubstance abuse programs at an approximate cost of20 million dollars\nannually. Yet non-English speaking prisoners have difficulty\nunderstanding, participating and completing these programs. Program\ncontent and materials are presented in English; few substance abuse\ncounselors or program staff are bilingual. This bill would require\nthe Commissioner to take steps to address this problem, without\nimposing specific methods or timeliness, thus preserving the\nflexibility of the department to proceed incrementally and to develop\nstrategies that reflect both security and budgetary limitations. The\nbill calls for the Commissioner of Corrections to consult with the\nCommissioner on Alcohol and Substance Abuse Services in order to\nensure that strategies developed are evidence-based, effective and\nprofessionally implemented.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2009-2010 - S.4367/A.7158(Ortiz) - reported and committed to finance\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\nTo be determined.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act shall take effect immediately.\n\n",
