  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1680\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the civil service\nlaw, in relation to making it a discriminatory\npractice for public employers\nto compensate employees of different sexes differently for work\nthat is of comparable worth\n\nPURPOSE OR GENERAL IDEA OF BILL:\nThe purpose of this bill is to ensure that public employees,\nregardless of sex, working in positions of comparable worth are paid\nequally.\n\nSUMMARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:\nThis bill would:\n\n* make the practice whereby employees in a particular position or\ntitle are paid at a salary or rate lower than that which other\nemployees of the opposite sex in a comparable position or title are\ncompensated, an unlawful discriminatory practice;\n\n* define comparable worth as measured by skill, effort and\nresponsibility normally required in the performance of work and\nconditions under which work is normally performed;\n\n* prohibit an employer from reducing the compensation of any employee\nor position in order to comply with the provisions of this legislation;\n\n* enable employers to implement the provisions of this bill by\ninstituting a plan that would lead to full compliance within three\nyears following enactment;\n\n* not prohibit different compensation pursuant to a seniority system;\nand\n\n* not impede, infringe or diminish the rights and benefits contained\nin a collective bargaining agreement or diminish the integrity of an\nexisting bargaining agreement.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nA recent public hearing held by a number of Assembly Committees\nrevealed troubling situations where women who were performing work\ncomparable to their male counterparts were paid substantially less in\nsalary. In particular, there was testimony that school nurses and\nsecretaries were paid less than maintenance and grounds keepers of\nthe same employer, although the required training, responsibilities\nand skills of the nurses and secretaries surpassed that of the male\nstaff Discrimination based on stereotyped gender roles is\n\ninappropriate. This legislation is needed to ensure that pay equity\nin the public sector is achieved.\n\nPRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nFirst introduced in 1998 and has passed the Assembly every session\nsince then.In 2009, it was reported from the Senate Civil Service\nand Pensions Committee but died in Finance.  In 2010, it was\nreported from the Senate Civil Service and Pensions and Finance\nCommittees but died in Rules.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS:\nNone where employees in positions of comparable worth are paid the\nsame salary or rate.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n90 days after enactment.\n\n",
