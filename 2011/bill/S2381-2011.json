  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2381\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nCONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY\nproposing an amendment to section 8 of article 4 of the constitution, in\nrelation to legislative review of rules and regulations\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nTo allow the legislature to invalidate regulations that are not\nconsistent with legislative intent or which are likely to have a\nsubstantial unanticipated fiscal impact on the state or local\ngovernments.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nThis bill will amend the Constitution to allow the legislature by\nmajority vote of both houses to invalidate regulations not consistent\nwith the legislative intent or which are likely to have a substantial\nunanticipated fiscal impact on the state or local governments.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\n\nThere is no provision similar to this in the New York Constitution.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nThe intent of the legislature in passing a particular statute must be\nthe paramount concern in drafting rules and regulations implementing\nthe statute. The will of the legislature should not be altered or\ncircumvented by state agencies drafting rules and regulations. When\nrules and regulations exceed or stray from the legislative intent,\nthere may be unanticipated burdens placed on the constituents of\nthe legislators which voted for the legislation at issue. In\naddition, in these tight financial times, it is also important that\nregulations do not impose costs on the state or local\ngovernments which were not anticipated by the legislature at the time\nof passage of the legislation which the regulations are implementing.\n\nThis bill would allow the legislature to identify and eliminate\nregulations that the legislature never intended which may impose\nneedless burdens and costs on consumers, businesses or government.\nSpecifically, this bill would amend the Constitution to authorize the\nlegislature to review any rule or regulation to determine if it is\nconsistent with the intent of the legislature or if it would have a\nsubstantial unanticipated fiscal impact on the state or local\ngovernments. Upon making such a finding through a concurrent\nresolution to the governor and the head of the appropriate agency,\nthe agency would be required to amend or withdraw the regulation. In\n\nthe event that the agency fails to take such action within thirty\ndays, the legislature may vote to invalidate such regulation.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\nS.3048 of 2009-10; S.6982 of 2008\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nResolved (if the Assembly concur), That the foregoing amendment be\nreferred to the first regular legislative session convening after the\nnext succeeding general election of members of the assembly, and, in\nconformity with section 1 of article 19 of the constitution, be\npublished for 3 months previous to the time of such election.\n\n",
