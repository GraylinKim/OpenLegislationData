  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2544\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the real property tax law, in relation to the exemption from\ntaxation for non-profit organizations and to repeal certain provisions\nof such law relating thereto\n\nPURPOSE:\nTo ensure that exempt properties are being used in the manner which\nsupports the specific exemption granted.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nRepeals subdivision 3 of section 420-a of the real property tax law to\nadd a new subdivision 3 to provide that vacant or otherwise\nunimproved land shall only be deemed tax exempt if concrete and\ndefinite plans for utilizing and adapting the property for exempt\npurposes within two years are proven by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nEXISTING LAW:\nExisting law does not provide a date certain by which real property\nnot in actual use for its exempt purpose(s) must be developed or\notherwise improved to facilitate such activity.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nLand-banking occurs when tax exempt organizations purchase land for\ncontemplated use. The problem is that often times contemplated use\ndoes not occur or takes years to occur. While that land is tied up,\ntaxes are not being paid, and the land is not being put to productive\nuse. This diminishes the overall tax base of a locality.\nWhen the tax base of a locality is diminished, the remaining taxpayers\nburden increases. This makes home ownership less affordable as\nproperty taxes grow.\n\nThis proposed measure is one of a series of bills aimed at\nrestructuring the framework for granting real property tax exemptions\nacross the state. Based on year 2000 assessment rolls, there are over\nfive million parcels of property in New York State (valued at a total\nof 1.3 trillion dollars). Of this number, some three million parcels\nenjoy at least 1 real property tax exemption. From a taxable status\nstandpoint, about 1/3 of the total value of property in New York\nState (441 billion dollars) is either wholly or partially exempt from\nreal property taxation.\n\nThe lion's share of real property tax exemptions (around 68%) are\nstate mandated, and while the state has provided some reimbursement\nto relieve local taxing jurisdictions (i.e., through the STAR\nprogram), high levels of tax exemptions can present a serious burden\nto other property owners who must support the cost of school\ndistrict, municipal and special district operations.\n\nIt is imperative that the State address and limit exemptions to those\norganizations and purposes which most broadly benefit the public. This\nspecific legislation promotes this thrust by ensuring that\norganizations seeking tax exemptions truly meet those public\npurposes, and that lands receiving relief from real property taxation\nare being fully used in support of such purposes.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.6838  of 2010: Referred to Local Government\nS.1126A of 2003: Referred to Local Government\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nin 0\nNone to the state.\n\nLOCAL FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nUndetermined, however, it is anticipated the bill will offer improved\nlocal oversight of exemptions, with a salutary effect on school,\nmunicipal and special district (ie., fire protection) tax rolls.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nThis act would take effect on the first of January next succeeding the\ndate on which it shall have become a law and would apply to\nassessment rolls prepared on the basis of taxable status dates\noccurring on or after such date.\n\n",
