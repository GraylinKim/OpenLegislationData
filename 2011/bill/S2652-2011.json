  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2652\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the labor law, in relation to requiring employers to provide\nsafety ropes and system components to firefighters; and to repeal\nparagraph e of subdivision 1 of section 27-a of the labor law relating\nto the definition of \"system components\"\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nThis Bill would require the Department of Labor to promulgate\nregulations concerning the rapid egress by firefighters when engaged\nin fire suppression activities at above grade floors during structure\nfires.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nSection 1 of the Bill repeals the definition of \"system components\"\nfound in paragraph e of subdivision 1 of section 27-a of the Labor Law.\n\nSection 2 of the Bill amends subdivision 4 of section 27-a of the\nLabor Law to require the Commissioner of the Department of Labor to\npromulgate regulations concerning the rapid egress by firefighters\nwhen engaged in fire suppression activities at above grade floors\nduring structure fires.\n\nSection 3 of the bill is the effective date.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nOn January 23, 2005, six (6) New York City Firefighters were caught on\nthe fourth floor of a burning building in the Bronx. The\nfirefighters, however, were not equipped with safety ropes and\naccompanying equipment. All six (6) men were forced to jump from the\nbuilding, resulting in serious injury to four (4) and the death of\ntwo (2). This incident has become commonly referred to as \"Black\nSunday\" in the firefighting community.\n\nIn response to the Black Sunday incident, the Legislature eventually\nenacted Chapter 433 of the Laws of 2008 (\"Chapter 433\"), which\nrequired, among other things, that the Commissioner of the Department\nof Labor (the \"Commissioner\") to promulgate regulations to adopt the\ncodes, standards, and recommended practices promulgated by the \"most\nrecent\" edition (i.e., the 2006 edition) of National Fire Protection\nAssociation (\"NFPA\") 1983 Standard on Fire Service Life Safety Rope\nAnd System Components.\n\nNFPA standards, however, are continually changing in order to maintain\npace with advancements in technology. By restricting the Commissioner\nto the 2006 edition of the NFPA 1983 Standard, Chapter 433 has, in\n\neffect, hampered the Commissioner's ability to effectively respond to\nchanges in technology, which could have the unintended effect of\nputting firefighters' lives at risk.\n\nIn addition, firefighters carry certain standard equipment, which may\nbe used during a self rescue/escape, that may not be covered by the\nNFPA 1983 Standard. For example, it is an accepted practice for a\nfirefighter to carry a Halligan bar (also called a Halligan tool)\ninto a building. To be sure, in most fire companies, firefighters do\nnot enter a building without one. One of the many accepted uses for\nthe Halligan Bar is for a firefighter to use it during a self\nrescue/escape\n- i.e., the exact situation covered by Chapter 433. It is an\naccepted practice (and one that is taught during training) for a\nfirefighter who faces a self rescue/escape situation to jam or\nwedge his Halligan bar into a wall or a corner as an anchor point,\ntie off his rope to it and proceed to extract himself out a window.\nThe problem, however, is that a Halligan bar is currently not covered\nby the NFPA 1983. In effect what Chapter 433 has inadvertently done\nis to prevent the firefighting community to use equipment generally\nrecognized as acceptable because it is not covered by the NFPA 1983\nStandard On Fire Service life Safety Rope And System Components.\n\nThis Bill will provide the Commissioner with the latitude to\neffectively respond to the needs of the firefighting community and to\nensure the safety, to consider alternatives and to provide\ncommunities with the flexibility to equip their firefighters with\nequipment that best suits their unique needs.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n\nThis is a new Bill.\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nMinimal.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nImmediately.\n\n",
