  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S1752\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\n\nAn act\nto amend the penal law, in relation to increasing the penalties for\nsale of controlled substances on park grounds or playgrounds\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\n\nThis bill adds a new subdivision 14-a to section 220.00 to the Penal\nLaw to define \"park grounds or playgrounds.\" This new definition\nincludes open or enclosed grounds which are leased, owned or\nmaintained by the state or a municipality or a not for profit or\nother similar entity for recreation or leisure.\n\nIt amends section 220.34 of the Penal Law, criminal sale of a\ncontrolled substance in the fourth degree, to make it a class C\nfelony to sell a controlled substance on park grounds or playgrounds.\nThis is added to the existing prohibition against such sale on school\ngrounds.\n\nThe bill also amends section 220.44 of the Penal Law, Criminal sale of\na controlled substance in or near school grounds, to extend the\nprohibition to park grounds or playgrounds. The prohibition includes:\nsale of a narcotic preparation; a dangerous depressant or a\ndepressant and the dangerous depressant weighs ten ounces or more, or\nthe depressant weighs two pounds or more; or concentrated cannabis;\nor phencyclidine and the phencyclidine weighs fifty milligrams or\nmore; or methadone; or any amount of phencyclidine and has previously\nbeen convicted of an offense defined in this article or the attempt\nor conspiracy to commit any such offense; or ketamine and said\nketamine weighs four thousand milligrams or more.\n\nThe prohibition also includes a narcotic drug; or a stimulant,\nhallucinogen, hallucinogenic substance, or lysergic acid diethylamide\nand has previously been convicted of an offense defined in article\ntwo hundred twenty or the attempt or conspiracy to commit any such\noffense; or a stimulant and the stimulant weighs one gram or more; or\nlysergic acid diethylamide and the lysergic acid diethylamide weighs\none milligram or more; or a hallucinogen and the hallucinogen weighs\ntwenty-five milligrams or more; or a hallucinogenic substance and the\nhallucinogenic substance weighs one gram or more; or one or more\npreparations, compounds, mixtures or substances containing\nmethamphetamine, its salts, isomers or salts of isomers and the\npreparations, compounds, mixtures or substances are of an aggregate\nweight of one-eighth ounce or more; or phencyclidine and the\nphencyclidine weighs two hundred fifty milligrams or more; or a\nnarcotic preparation to a person less than twenty-one years old.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\n\nThe State of New York has consistently recognized that drug dealers\nwho target children are especially dangerous to society and, as such,\nshould be subjected to stiffer penalties for breaking the law in such\nfashion.  This effort began with the \"Drugs in School Law\" which\n\n\ntargeted those who sell drugs on or near school grounds.  Later, this\nwas expanded to include child day care or educational facilities.\nThis legislation would take an important next step by targeting those\ndrug dealers who lurk in public parks and playgrounds in an effort to\ntarget our children.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\nS.922 (Mega) 1992 - Passed Senate/recalled and amended\nS.2157 (Mega) 1993 - Passed Senate\nS.2224 2003-2004 - Passed Senate\nS.1197 - Passed Senate\nS.1777 - 2007-2008 Passed Senate\nS.1568 - 2009-2010 Codes\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\n\nThe first of November next succeeding the date on which it shall\nbecome a law.\n\n",
