  "memo" : "BILL NUMBER:S2462\n\nTITLE OF BILL:\nAn act\nto amend the environmental conservation law, in relation to authorizing\nangling by a single individual with up to three lines\n\nPURPOSE:\nThis legislation would authorize an individual to angle for fish with\nup to 3 lines.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:\nAmends section 11-0103 of the Environmental Conservation Law to change\nthe number of lines one person may operate from not more than two to\nnot more than three, with or without rod.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:\nThis new 3-rod rule is designed to favorably impact a fisherman's\nexperience by increasing his probability of catching a fish. Catching\na fish enhances angler satisfaction more than any other factor and is\nthe prime determinant in deciding whether or not to make return\nvisits to the fisheries of New York.\n\nReturn visits to the fishery are a boon to the local economies. Return\ntrips mean more money spent locally for fuel, food, lodging,\nlaunches, parking, and rentals.\n\nThe 3-rod rule will not guarantee that people catch more fish; rather\nit will give them the potential to locate the fish a little easier.\nThe small crewed boats, the 'weekend warrior', the recreationalist,\nthe vacationer, the retired couple who have saved up for a boat and\nnow have the time and health to use it will all benefit from this.\n\nIt does not mean they must use 3 rods, it will mean they can use 3\nrods per person, whether they are operated from land or from a boat,\nif they so choose. New Jersey and Michigan both have a 3-rod rule, to\nwhich they have continued to see a favorable impact to their\nrecreational fisherman.\n\nIn addition, the 3-rod rule will not exploit the fishery since\nexploitation is constrained by creel limits that would still be in\neffect.\n\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY:\n2010:  S.6453 - Passed Senate\n\nFISCAL IMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE:\nImmediately.\n\n",
